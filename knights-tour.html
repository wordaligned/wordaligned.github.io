<h1>Life A User&rsquo;s Manual</h1>
<p>by Georges Perec is set in 11 rue Simon-Crubellier at 8pm, June 23, 1975.
<p>It tells you all you need to know about life.
<p>It contains algorithms and puzzles too.
<hr/>

<p>"Life A User&rsquo;s Manual" is the book I&rsquo;d take to a desert island. As its title
suggests, it tells you everything you need to know about life. It&rsquo;s also packed
with great stories, and hidden inside are secret algorithms and mind-bending
puzzles.

<p><img style="width: 400px;" src="/images/perec.jpg" alt="Perec" />

<p>The book&rsquo;s author Georges Perec was &mdash; and still is
&mdash; a member of <a href="http://oulipo.net/">OuLiPo</a>, a
literary collective of writers and mathematicians who apply algorithms
and formal constraints to works of fiction. For example:

<ul>

  <li>Perec himself wrote a full length <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void">book</a> which avoids any
 use of the letter <strong>E</strong>

  <li>Richard Beard&rsquo;s novel, <a
 href="http://www.richardbeard.info/category/my-books/damascus/">Damascus</a>,
takes every noun from a particular edition of the Times newspaper

  <li>Raymond Queneau wrote a <a
 href="http://www.growndodo.com/wordplay/oulipo/10%5e14sonnets.html">combinatorial
poem</a> comprising a hundred thousand billion sonnets; open it at
random, and you&rsquo;re likely to find a poem noone has read before,
including the author

</ul>

<p>Life A User&rsquo;s Manual is a tour de force of such
techniques. It&rsquo;s also a <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour">knight&rsquo;s
tour</a>. The diagram above shows the layout of 11 rue Simon
Crubellier, Paris, where the action takes place. It&rsquo;s a 10 by 10
grid. On floor 3, Percival Bartlebooth inhabits a large flat. Serge
Valene, the artist, has a bedsit. Smautf, Bartlebooth&rsquo;s
man-servant, lives in an attic room. The basement contains cellars,
lift machinery. And so on.

<p>The knight starts in the centre of the building, on the stairs, where chapter
1 begins. Taking a step, the knight arrives in Madame de Beaumont&rsquo;s flat,
where chapter 2 is set. Now to chapter 3, the Foreau&rsquo;s; 4, Marquiseaux;
eventually finishing at chapter 99, located in the room where Percival Bartlebooth
is struggling to finish a jigsaw puzzle made by the late Gaspard Winckler.

<p>The knight&rsquo;s tour will visit each square exactly once, providing an
elegant route through the novel. Perec devised a more intricate scheme to
furnish the chapters. Here&rsquo;s
an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeco-Latin_square">Euler square</a>
of order 5. The Latin characters A to E and the Greek &alpha; to &epsilon; are
arranged so that each pair occurs once and each letter appears exactly once on
every row and column.

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeco-Latin_square"><img style="width: 400px;" src="/images/greco-latin.png" alt="Euler square" /></a>

<p>Now imagine a 10 by 10 Euler square. Euler himself couldn&rsquo;t construct one and
conjectured none existed, and it took 200 years before a computer program proved
otherwise. Just what Perec needed! He overlaid his chess board with an Euler
square of order 10 populated not by 2 lists of letters, but by 42 lists of 10
things.

<ul>
<li>Positions. Kneeling, sitting, prone, coming, going ...
<li>Quotations. The chapter must smuggle in text from works by Flaubert, Kafka,
Queneau ...
<li>More lists: furniture, clothes, food, drink, jewellery, animals, colours,
numbers of pages etc.
</ul>


<p>The knight&rsquo;s tour and Euler square form an engine which generates a text like
no other. If Perec&rsquo;s User Manual sounds like an elaborate catalog, well, in a
sense it is; but Perec is a story teller of genius and his solution to the
combined constraints is a web of interlocking stories. A page turner! If, on the
first read, you can&rsquo;t stop to savour the details, never mind: there&rsquo;s a
comprehensive index so you can return to a favourite section later. Besides,
you&rsquo;ll have time on your island.

<p>Of course there&rsquo;s a bug: the OuLiPo know all about the clinamen, the
deviation exhibited by even the smallest sub-atomic particles. Wind the knight
back to chapter 65. On the next step the knight fails to visit the bottom left
corner, instead making an illegal move to a diagonal neighbour. This twist is
what makes the book truly lifelike. As software developers, maybe Perec and the
Oulipo have a lesson for us. Rather than despair of the bugs in our work,
perhaps we should celebrate them for keeping our products real.
