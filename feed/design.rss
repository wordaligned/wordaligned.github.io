<title>Drawing Software Designs</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-28.html#%_thm_4.45"&gt;Exercise 4.45&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"&gt;Wizard Book&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following sentence can be parsed in five different ways: &amp;#8220;The
   professor lectures to the student in the class with the cat.&amp;#8221;
   Give the five parses and explain the differences in shades of
   meaning among them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find a formal representation of the five parses at the end of
   this post. I found it easiest to describe the different shades of
   meaning with a diagram.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id="continue-reading"/&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The Different Shades of Meaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src="http://wordaligned.org/images/ex4.45.jpg" width="100%" alt="The cat, the class, the student, the professor"/&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Drawing as a Design Tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use drawings all the time when I&amp;#8217;m writing software. Pencil and
   paper are good enough for many jobs; whiteboard and pen are perfect
   for others. I enjoy using these tools and they allow me to communicate
   ideas very efficiently &amp;#8212; when you work in this way, you soon build a
   &lt;a href="http://www.hasbro.com/default.cfm?page=browse&amp;amp;product_id=9475"&gt;Pictionary&lt;/a&gt;-style rapport with colleagues, and a simple rectangle becomes a
   class, or a server, or an item on a queue, or anything else you want it to be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the drawings themselves are ephemeral. It&amp;#8217;s the act of
   producing the picture which shapes the design. There&amp;#8217;s never been any
   question of feeding the drawing into the computer and having it
   generate code. (Though the reverse trip sometimes works: given source
   code, a computer can sketch a hyper-linked class heirarchy, for
   example). Similarly, I&amp;#8217;ve never seen real benefits from the various 
   corners of the UML syntax. Please, keep it simple.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hit on a drawing you do want to save, there&amp;#8217;s no need to transpose
   it into a computer drawing package; that&amp;#8217;s sure to take time and risks
   stifling the picture. Instead, just scan in or photograph the original
   and put it on the wiki.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Computer Drawing Packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer drawing packages generally leave me cold. They really don&amp;#8217;t
   seem to have moved on since the version of Mac Draw I encountered over
   twenty years ago, back when a mouse was a novel input device. It took
   me about 10 minutes to draw the picture above by hand, of which most
   of the time was spent thinking. Using a computer, I should think it
   would have taken well over an hour, of which most of my time would
   have been spent cursing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; like about computer drawing packages is that they
   allow you to animate a drawing &amp;#8212; for example to replay it, starting from 
   a blank page, adding features in turn. I&amp;#8217;ve seen this technique used very effectively
   in presentations. Building these pictures is, however, a painful process.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Five Parses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, the five different parses are:
&lt;/p&gt;
