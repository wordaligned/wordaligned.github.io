</div><p>I chanced upon an interesting puzzle:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Find the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of 5, 17, 563, 641 consecutive prime numbers, and is itself a prime number.
</p>
</blockquote><img src="/images/primes.png" alt="Small primes graphic"/>


<h3><a href="#toc0" name="tocinfinite-series-and-python" id="tocinfinite-series-and-python">Infinite series and Python</a></h3>
<p>The prime numbers famously form an infinite series and my first thought was to tackle this puzzle using Python iterators and generators. Courtesy of the Python Cookbook, I already had a couple of <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/excerpt/pythonckbk_chap1/index1.html?page=2">useful</a> <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/491285-iterator-merge/">recipes</a>:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">def primes():
    '''Generate the sequence of prime numbers: 2, 3, 5 ... '''
    ....

def stream_merge(*ss):
    '''Merge a collection of sorted streams.
    
    Example: merge multiples of 2, 3, 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import count, islice
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def multiples(x): return (x * n for n in count(1))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; s = stream_merge(multiples(2), multiples(3), multiples(5))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(islice(s, 12))
    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 10, 10, 12, 12]
    '''
    ....

</pre>

</div>

<p>Both these functions merit a closer look for the cunning use they make of standard containers, but we&#8217;ll defer this inspection until later. In passing, note that <code>stream_merge()</code>&#8217;s docstring suggests we might try using it as basis for <code>primes()</code>:
</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>form the series of composite (non-prime) numbers by merging the streams formed by multiples of prime numbers; 
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>the primes remain when you remove these composites from the series of natural numbers.
</p>

 </li>
</ol>
<p>This scheme is hardly original &#8212; it&#8217;s a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes&#8217; famous sieve</a> &#8212; but if you look carefully you&#8217;ll notice the self-reference. Unfortunately recursive definitions of infinite series don&#8217;t work well with Python<a id="fn1link" href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, hence <code>primes()</code> requires a little more finesse. We&#8217;ll take a look at it later.
</p>
<p>Moving on then, to solve the original puzzle we need a consecutive sum filter. This takes a stream of numbers and yields a stream of consecutive sums of these numbers:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">def consecutive_sum(s, n):
    '''Generate the series of sums of n consecutive elements of s
    
    Example: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ... =&gt; 0+1, 1+2, 2+3, 3+4, ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import count, islice
    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(islice(consecutive_sum(count(), 2), 10))
    [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
    '''
    lo, hi = itertools.tee(s)
    csum = sum(next(hi) for _ in range(n))
    while True:
        yield csum
        csum += next(hi) - next(lo)

</pre>

</div>

<p>Here we visualise the summed elements as lying within a sliding window: each time we slide the window an element gets added to the top and an element gets removed from the bottom, and we adjust <code>csum</code> accordingly.
</p>
<p>So, now we have:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     the series of prime numbers, <code>primes()</code>
 </li>

 <li>
     a <code>stream_merge()</code> connector
 </li>

 <li>
     a <code>consecutive_sum()</code> filter
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining stream adaptors come from the standard <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/itertools-functions.html">itertools module</a>. Note that the <code>stream_merge()</code> works here since all the consecutive sum series are strictly increasing. Note also that the stream of prime numbers can be treated as <code>consecutive_sum(s=primes(), n=1)</code>, handling the &#8220;and is itself a prime number&#8221; requirement.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">&gt;&gt;&gt; lens = 1, 5, 17, 563, 641
&gt;&gt;&gt; N = len(lens)
&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import tee, groupby
&gt;&gt;&gt; ps = tee(primes(), N)
&gt;&gt;&gt; csums = [consecutive_sum(p, n) for p, n in zip(ps, lens)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; solns = (n for n, g in groupby(stream_merge(*csums)) 
             if len(list(g)) == N)
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(solns)
7002221

</pre>

</div>

<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of how these stream tools link up to solve this particular puzzle. The great thing is that we can reconnect these same tools to solve a wide range of puzzles, and indeed more practical <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/">processing tasks</a>. To use the common analogy, we direct data streams along pipes.

<h3><a href="#toc1" name="tocinfinite-series-in-other-languages" id="tocinfinite-series-in-other-languages">Infinite series in Other Languages</a></h3>
<p>Python is the high-level language I find most convenient most of the time, which explains why I reached for it first. It&#8217;s an increasingly popular language, which helps explain why it I didn&#8217;t need to write the tricky parts of my solution from scratch: they&#8217;d already been done. Python is also a language which makes compromises. Having used Python to find a solution to the puzzle I wondered if there wasn&#8217;t some other language better suited to this kind of problem.
</p>
<p><a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a> makes no compromises when it comes to functional programming. Its lazy evaluation and guilt-free recursion make it a perfect fit for this kind of puzzle &#8212; but my Pythonic approach of teeing, filtering and merging streams made me think first of the Unix Shell. Now, I use Bash every day and page through its manual at least once a week. Scripting appeals and I&#8217;m comfortable at the command line. How hard could it be to solve this puzzle using Bash? After all, I already knew the answer! Let&#8217;s give it a go.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc2" name="tocpartial-sums" id="tocpartial-sums">Partial sums.</a></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a simple shell function to generate partial sums. I&#8217;ve used <code>awk</code>, a little language I gave up on a long time ago in favour of more rounded scripting languages like Perl and then Python. Now I look at it again, it seems to fill a useful gap. Awk processes a file sequentially, applying pattern-action rules to each line, a processing pattern which I&#8217;ve reinvented less cleanly many times. Despite my rediscovery of <code>awk</code>, I&#8217;ll be keeping its use strongly in check in what follows.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ psum() { awk '{ print s += $1 }'; }

</pre>

</div>

<p>Much like Perl, <code>awk</code> guesses what you want to do. Here, it conjures the summation variable, <code>s</code>, into existence, assigning it a default initial value of 0. (Good guess!) Since we&#8217;re doing arithmetic <code>awk</code> converts the first field of each input line into a number. We can test <code>psum</code> by using <code>jot</code> to generate the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (on a Linux platform use <code>seq</code> instead of <code>jot</code>).
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ jot 5 | psum
1
3
6
10
15

</pre>

</div>


<h3><a href="#toc3" name="tocconsecutive-sums" id="tocconsecutive-sums">Consecutive sums</a></h3>
<p>You may be wondering why we&#8217;ve bothered creating this partial sum filter since it&#8217;s the sums of consecutive elements we&#8217;re after, rather than the sum of the series so far. Well, notice that if P[i] and P[i+n] are two elements from the series of partial sums of S, then their difference, P[i+n] - P[i], is the sum of the n consecutive elements from S.
</p>
<p>So to form an n-element consecutive sum series we can tee the partial sums streams, advance one of these by n, then zip through them in parallel finding their differences. An example makes things clear:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ mkfifo pipe
$ jot 5 | psum | tee pipe | tail -n +2 | paste - pipe
3       1
6       3
10      6
15      10
        15

</pre>

</div>

<p>Here, <code>jot 5</code> generates the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, which <code>psum</code> progressively accumulates to 1, 3, 6, 10, 15. We then <code>tee</code> this partial sum series through two pipes: the first, <code>pipe</code>, is an explicitly created named pipe created by <code>mkfifo</code>, the second is implicitly created by the pipeline operator, <code>|</code>. The remainder of the command line delays one series by one (note that <code>tail</code> numbers lines from <code>1</code>, not <code>0</code>, so <code>tail -n +1</code> is the identity filter) then pastes the two series back together<a id="fn2link" href="#fn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>By appending a single <code>awk</code> action to the pipeline we get a consecutive sum series.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ jot 5 | psum | tee pipe | tail -n +2 | paste - pipe | awk '{print $1 - $2}'
2
3
4
5
15

</pre>

</div>

<p>The output 2, 3, 4, 5 is the series of consecutive sums of length 1 taken from the original series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The trailing 15 and the 1 missed from the start are edge case problems, and easily corrected. 
</p>
<p>Accumulating an increasing series of numbers in order to find the differences between elements lying a given distance apart on this series isn&#8217;t a very smart idea on a computer with a fixed word-size, but it&#8217;s good to know (e.g.) that <code>awk</code> doesn&#8217;t stop counting at 32 bits.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ let "N=1&lt;&lt;32" &amp;&amp; echo $N | tee &gt;(awk '{print $1 * $1}')
4294967296
18446744073709551616

</pre>

</div>

<p>Exactly if and when awk stops counting, I&#8217;m not sure. The documentation doesn&#8217;t say and I haven&#8217;t looked at the source code.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc4" name="tocbug-fixes" id="tocbug-fixes">Bug Fixes</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s capture these tiny functions and name them. Here, then, are revised <code>psum()</code> and <code>sdiff()</code> filters. The edge case problems should now be fixed.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ psum()  { awk 'BEGIN { print 0 }{print s += $1 }'; }
$ delay() { let "n = $1 + 1" &amp;&amp; tail +$n; } 
$ sdiff() { mkfifo p.$1 &amp;&amp; tee p.$1 | delay $1 | paste - p.$1 | \
            awk 'NF == 2 {print $1 - $2 }'; }

</pre>

</div>

<p>A quick test:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ jot 5 | psum | sdiff 3
6
9
12

</pre>

</div>

<p>The output is, as expected, the series of sums of consecutive triples taken from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (1+2+3, 2+3+4, 3+4+5).
</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a more pernicious bug, though. <code>Sdiff</code> can&#8217;t handle an infinite series, so it&#8217;s of limited use as a pipeline tool. For example, if we stream it the series 0, 1, 2, &#8230; (generated here as the partial sums of the series 1, 1, 1, &#8230;) nothing gets output and we have to interrupt the process.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint"># This command appears to hang
$ yes 1 | psum | sdiff 1
^C

</pre>

</div>

<p>I found a way to work around this problem by redirecting the teed stream to a subshell which itself redirects into a named pipe.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ sdiff() { mkfifo p.$1 &amp;&amp; tee &gt;(delay $1 &gt;p.$1) | paste - p.$1 | \
            awk 'NF == 2 {print $2 - $1 }'; }
$ yes 1 | psum | sdiff 1
1
1
1
1
^C

</pre>

</div>

<p>As you can see this gets data flowing once again, but I&#8217;m already out of my comfort zone: I couldn&#8217;t tell you why exactly this works but the preceding version doesn&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>(You can of course write a consecutive sum function directly in <code>awk</code>: here&#8217;s a version which leans hard on the &#8220;do what I mean&#8221; style of programming, accessing and deleting array entries which haven&#8217;t even been set.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">csum() { 
awk -v n=$1 
'{lo = NR - n; w[NR] = $1; s += $1 - w[lo]; delete w[lo]}' \
'NR &gt;= n {print s}'
}

</pre>

</div>

<p>For this article I&#8217;ve avoided pushing the consecutive sum job <code>awk</code>&#8217;s way because I&#8217;m more interested in figuring out how this pipe-connection works for non-trivial cases. Any advice would be welcome!)
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc5" name="tocmerging-streams" id="tocmerging-streams">Merging Streams</a></h3>
<p>The Unix shell merges streams rather more succinctly than Python. <code>Sort -m</code> does the job directly. Note that a standard <code>sort</code> cannot yield any output until all its inputs are exhausted, since the final input item might turn out to be the one which should appear first in the output. Merge sort, <code>sort -m</code> can and does produce output without delay<a id="fn3link" href="#fn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.

<h3><a href="#toc6" name="tocgenerating-primes" id="tocgenerating-primes">Generating Primes</a></h3>
<p>No doubt it&#8217;s possible to generate the infinite series of prime numbers using native Bash code, but I chose to reuse the <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/excerpt/pythonckbk_chap1/index1.html?page=2">Python Cookbook recipe</a> for the job.
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">primes</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">#!/usr/bin/env python
import itertools

def primes():
    '''Generate the prime number series: 2, 3, 5 ... '''
    D = {}
    for n in itertools.count(2):
        p = D.pop(n, None)
        if p is None:
            yield n
            D[n * n] = n
        else:
            x = n + p
            while x in D:
                x += p
            D[x] = p

for p in primes():
    print(p)

</pre>

</div>

<p>This is a subtle little program which makes clever use of Python&#8217;s native hashed array container, the dictionary. In this case dictionary values are the primes less than <code>n</code> and the keys are composite multiples of these primes. The loop invariant, roughly speaking, is that the dictionary values are the primes less than <code>n</code>, and the corresponding keys are the lowest multiples of these primes greater than or equal to <code>n</code>. It&#8217;s a lazy, recursion-free variant of Eratosthenes&#8217; sieve.
</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article the important things about this program are:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     it generates an infinite series of numbers to standard output<a id="fn4link" href="#fn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, making it a good source for a shell pipeline;
 </li>

 <li>
     by making it executable and adding the usual shebang incantation, we can invoke this Python program seamlessly from the shell.
 </li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#toc7" name="tocpipe-connection" id="tocpipe-connection">Pipe Connection</a></h3>
<p>Recall the original puzzle:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Find the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of 5, 17, 563, 641 consecutive prime numbers, and is itself a prime number.
</p>
</blockquote><p>First, let&#8217;s check the connections by solving a simpler problem which we can manually verify: to find prime numbers which are also the sum of 2 consecutive primes. As we noted before, this is the same as finding primes numbers which are the consecutive sums of 1 and 2 primes.
</p>
<p>In one shell window we create a couple of named pipes, <code>c.1</code> and <code>c.2</code>, which we&#8217;ll use to stream the consecutive sum series of 1 and 2 primes respectively. The results series comprises the duplicates when we merge these pipes.
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Shell 1</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ mkfifo c.{1,2}
$ sort -mn c.{1,2} | uniq -d

</pre>

</div>

<p>In another shell window, stream data into c.1 and c.2:
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Shell 2</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ for i in 1 2; do (primes | psum | sdiff $i &gt; c.$i) &amp; done

</pre>

</div>

<p>In the first window we see the single number <code>5</code>, which is the first and only prime number equal to the sum of two primes.
</p>
<p>Prime numbers equal to the sum of three consecutive primes are more interesting. In each shell window recall the previous commands and switch the 2s to 3s (a simple command history recall and edit, <code>^2^3^</code>, does the trick). The merged output now looks like this:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ sort -mn c.1 c.3 | uniq -d
23
31
41
...

</pre>

</div>

<p>We can check the first few values:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">23 = 5 + 7 + 11
31 = 7 + 11 + 13
41 = 11 + 13 + 17

</pre>

</div>

<p>At this point we&#8217;re confident enough to give the actual puzzle a try. Start up the solutions stream.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ mkfifo c.{1,5,17,563,641}
$ sort -mn c.{1,5,17,563,641} | uniq -c | grep "5 "

</pre>

</div>

<p>Here, we use a standard <a href="/articles/shell-script-sets">shell script set intersection</a> recipe: <code>uniq -c</code> groups and counts repeated elements, and the <code>grep</code> pattern matches those numbers common to all five input streams.
</p>
<p>Now we can kick off the processes which will feed into the consecutive sum streams, which <code>sort</code> is waiting on.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ for i in 1 5 17 563 641; do (primes | psum | sdiff $i &gt; c.$i) &amp; done

</pre>

</div>

<p>Sure enough, after about 15 seconds elapsed time<a id="fn5link" href="#fn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, out pops the result:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ sort -mn c.{1,5,17,563,641} | uniq -c | grep "5 "
    5 7002221

</pre>

</div>

<p>15 seconds seems an eternity for arithmetic on a modern computer (you could start up a word processor in less time!), and you might be inclined to blame the overhead of all those processes, files, large numbers, etc. In fact it took around 6 seconds for the Python program simply to generate prime numbers up to 7002221, and my pure Python solution ran in 9 seconds.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc8" name="tocpipe-teeing" id="tocpipe-teeing">Pipe Teeing</a></h3>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">5 &times; primes | sum</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ for i in 1 5 17 563 641; do (primes | psum | sdiff $i &gt; c.$i) &amp; done

</pre>

</div>

<p>This shell solution works but I&#8217;m not happy with it. The source loop spawns 5 separate instances of <code>primes</code> and pipes them all through <code>psum</code>. I don&#8217;t care about giving the computer more to do than necessary, but I do wish I could figure out the details of this dataflow plumbing. What I&#8217;d <em>like</em> to do is split the output of <code>primes | psum</code> five ways, connecting each resulting stream to an instance of <code>sdiff</code>. Something <em>like</em> the following:
</p>

<p>When I run this sequence of commands nothing happens: by which I mean something blocks and nothing gets through to <code>sort</code>. Again, I&#8217;m out of my depth and not sure what&#8217;s going on &#8212; any advice would be welcome. The shell makes it all too easy to experiment, and I reckon I&#8217;ve already exhausted the obvious permutations of wax, tac, crunch, wane, amp, zap, tic, pretzel.

<h3><a href="#toc9" name="tocportability" id="tocportability">Portability</a></h3>
<p>One of the most convenient things about Python is its portability. I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;portable so long as you conform to the language standard&#8221; or &#8220;portable if you stick to a subset of the language&#8221; &#8212; I mean that a Python program works whatever platform I use without me having to worry about it. In fact I&#8217;m guilty of taking this portability for granted, and was surprised to discover a program of mine failed on Windows (the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-fcntl.html">fcntl module</a> is Unix only).
</p>
<p>Non-portability put me off the Unix shell when I first encountered it: there seemed too many details, too many platform differences &#8212; which shell are you using? which extensions? which implementation of the core utilities, etc, etc? Readily available and well-written documentation didn&#8217;t help much here: generally I want the shell to just do what I mean, which is why I switched so happily to Perl when I discovered it.
</p>
<p>Since then this situation has, for me, improved in many ways. Non-Unix platforms are declining as are the different flavours of Unix. Bash seems to have become the standard shell of choice and Cygwin gets better all the time. GNU coreutils predominate. As a consequence I&#8217;ve forgotten almost all the Perl I ever knew and am actively rediscovering the Unix shell.
</p>
<p>Writing this article, though, I was reminded of the platform dependent behaviour which used to discourage me. On a Linux platform close to hand I had to use <code>seq</code> instead of <code>jot</code>, and <code>awk</code> formatted large integers in a scientific form with a loss of precision.
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Loss of precision</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ echo '10000000001 0' | awk '{print $1 - $2}'
1e+10

</pre>

</div>

<p>On OS X the same command outputs 10000000001. I couldn&#8217;t tell you which implementation is more correct. The fix is to explicitly format these numbers as decimal integers, but the danger is that the shell silently swallows these discrepancies and you&#8217;ve got a portability problem you don&#8217;t even notice.
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Precision recovered</div>

<h3><a href="#toc10" name="tocstream-merge" id="tocstream-merge">Stream Merge</a></h3>
<p>I mentioned <code>stream_merge()</code> at the start of this article, a general purpose function written by Raymond Hettinger which I originally found in the Python Cookbook. As with the prime number generator, you might imagine the merge algorithm to be recursively defined:
</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>to merge a pair of streams, take items from the first which are less than the head of the second, then swap;
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>to merge N streams, merge the first stream with the merged (N-1) rest.
</p>

 </li>
</ol>
<p>Again the Python solution does it differently, this time using a heap as a priority queue of items from the input streams. It&#8217;s ingenious and efficient. Look how easy it is in Python to shunt functions and pairs in and out of queues.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">from heapq import heapify, heappop, heapreplace

def stream_merge(*ss):
    '''Merge a collection of sorted streams.'''
    pqueue = []
    for i in map(iter, ss):
        try:
            pqueue.append((i.next(), i.next))
        except StopIteration:
            pass
    heapify(pqueue)
    while pqueue:
        val, it = pqueue[0]
        yield val
        try:
            heapreplace(pqueue, (it(), it))
        except StopIteration:
            heappop(pqueue)

</pre>

<p>A more sophisticated version of this code has made it into the Python standard library, where it goes by the name of <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/heapq.html#heapq.merge">heapq.merge</a> (I wonder why it wasn&#8217;t filed in <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/itertools-functions.html">itertools</a>?)

<h2 class="title"><a href="/articles/productivity">Productivity++ != Better</a></h2>
<p class="meta"><abbr class="published" title="2016-07-14">2016-07-14</abbr> &bull; <a href="/tag/accu" rel="tag">ACCU</a> &bull; <a href="/articles/productivity#disqus_thread">Comments</a></p>
<p>When it comes to productivity there seems to be an assumption that it&#8217;s a good thing, and that more equals better. I&#8217;d like to question that. What matters is producing the right stuff, whatever that is, and if you&#8217;re not sure, producing less would be better.
</p>
<p>It can be hard to cancel work which is in progress or which has already been completed, even though, as software developers, version control can faithfully store and restore our work should we need it.
</p>
<p>More tests does not equal better either. An increasing unit test count would seem uncontroversial, but let&#8217;s not forget we&#8217;re aiming for coverage and completeness whilst avoiding redundancy.  Good unit tests and good design go hand in hand. Good unit tests avoid extended setup and good design reduces the need for combinatorial test suites. More system tests <strong>will</strong> slow down development, especially if they&#8217;re <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/flaky-tests-at-google-and-how-we.html">flaky</a>.
</p>
<p>I went to a wonderful and detailed <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/test-complexity">talk at ACCU 2014 by Wojciech Seliga</a>. He described his time as a development manager at Atlassian and the various steps taken to improve their CI builds: to speed them up and get them passing, that is. One particularly effective step was the daring elimination of an entire suite of fragile system tests. Late one evening, after a drink or two, a senior engineer just deleted them. Those tests haven&#8217;t failed since (!).
</p>
<p>I wonder how that engineer felt. Nervous maybe, a bit reckless perhaps. But productive? Can destruction be productive?
</p>
<p>On a similar note, one of the best changes made to the code base I work on has been to kill off unwanted configurations. We no longer support 32 bit builds: eliminating them has removed an entire class of integer conversion issues and slashed CI turnaround times. A reductive act, but one which allows us to produce more of what&#8217;s wanted.
</p>
<p>What is wanted though?
</p>
<p>The trouble is, if we&#8217;re not sure what to do, we like to do something, and we like to be seen to do something. We like to produce. We like to deliver. We don&#8217;t like to sit around in meetings talking about what to do. In these circumstances, though, production is questionable. More than once I have seen clean architecture crumble then decay, smothered by unwanted features.
</p>
<p>Project dashboards can add to the problem. Graphics showing who added the most lines of code are open to misinterpretation and gaming. Who had the best ideas? Who reduced, removed or simplified? Does your dashboard display these metrics?
</p>
<p>Remember, we are software developers, not software producers.

<p><a href="/articles/8-queens-puzzle">Yesterday I wrote about</a> a Python solution to the 8 Queens puzzle.

<pre><code>n = 8

<p>Here&#8217;s one of my favourite <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576647-eight-queens-six-lines">recipes, by Raymond Hettinger</a>, lightly adapted for Python 3.
</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import permutations

n = width_of_chessboard = 8
sqs = range(n)

Qs = (Q for Q in permutations(sqs)
      if n == len({Q[i]+i for i in sqs})
           == len({Q[i]-i for i in sqs}))
</code></pre><p>We start by assigning <code>sqs</code> to the range 0 through 7.
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sqs = range(8)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(sqs)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
</code></pre><p>The range has 8 indices. If each index represents a column on a standard 8x8 chessboard and the value at that index represents a row on the same chessboard, then our range represents 8 positions on the board. Using the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate">enumerate</a> function to generate these <code>(index, value)</code> pairs we see that <code>sqs</code> encodes the diagonal <code>(0, 0)</code> to <code>(7, 7)</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(enumerate(sqs))
[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7)]
</code></pre><p>Next, permute the values &#8212; the rows.
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import permutations
&gt;&gt;&gt; rooks = permutations(sqs)
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(rooks)
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(rooks)
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6)
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(rooks)
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 7)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(rooks)[34567]
(6, 7, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2)
</code></pre><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations">Itertools.permutations</a> generates values lazily. The snippet above shows the first two results, then skips forward 34568 places. <code>Permutations(sqs)</code> generates all possible arrangements of 8 pieces on a chessboard such that each row has exactly one piece on it and so does each column. That is, it generates all possible ways of placing 8 <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RooksProblem.html">rooks on a chessboard</a> so that no pair attacks each other.
</p>
<p>In the final program, we filter these rook positions to generate solutions to the more challenging &#8212; and more interesting &#8212; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">eight Queens puzzle</a>.
</p>
<p>Consider our starting point, the diagonal <code>(0, 0)</code> to <code>(7, 7)</code>
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; diagonal = range(8)
&gt;&gt;&gt; {r-c for c,r in enumerate(diagonal)}
{0}
&gt;&gt;&gt; {r+c for c,r in enumerate(diagonal)}
{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}
</code></pre><p>Here, a set comprehension collects the distinct values taken by the difference between the row and column along this diagonal, which in this case gives <code>{0}</code>. That is, if we placed 8 bishops along this &#x2197; diagonal they would all attack each other along this diagonal. The sum of the row and column takes 8 distinct values, however, meaning no pair attacks along a &#x2196; diagonal.
</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons">Comparison operators chain in Python</a>, so the expression:
</p>
<pre><code>n == len({Q[i]+i for i in sqs}) == len({Q[i]-i for i in sqs})
</code></pre><p>is <code>True</code> if both sets have 8 elements, that is, if the squares in <code>Q</code> are on distinct &#x2196; and &#x2197; diagonals; or, equivalently no pair of bishops placed on the squares in <code>Q</code> would attack each other. Since we already know <code>Q</code> positions 8 rooks so that no pair attacks each other, and a chess Queen combines the moves of a rook and a bishop, we can see that <code>Qs</code> generates every possible way of placing 8 Queens on a chessboard so that no pair attacks each other: which is to say, we&#8217;ve solved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">8 Queens puzzle</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>Qs = (Q for Q in permutations(sqs)
      if n == len({Q[i]+i for i in sqs})
           == len({Q[i]-i for i in sqs}))
</code></pre><p>This is beautiful code and there&#8217;s one final twist.
</p>
<p><code>Qs</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-expressions">generator expression</a> primed to permute squares into neighbourly rooks filtered by amicable bishops yielding unthreatening Queens. Until asked, however, it does nothing.

<h2 class="title"><a href="/articles/easy-as-py">Easy as Py</a></h2>
<p class="meta"><abbr class="published" title="2016-03-23">2016-03-23</abbr> &bull; <a href="/tag/python" rel="tag">Python</a>, <a href="/tag/c++" rel="tag">C++</a>, <a href="/tag/c" rel="tag">C</a> &bull; <a href="/articles/easy-as-py#disqus_thread">Comments</a></p>
<h2>What makes Python Simple?</h2>
<p>I consider Python a simple language. Here&#8217;s why.
</p>

<h2>Easy to Read</h2>
<p>I can read and understand Python code (unless it&#8217;s <a href="https://benkurtovic.com/2014/06/01/obfuscating-hello-world.html">wilfully perverse</a>). Syntactic whitespace and the associated removal of punctuation results in a regular, open layout. The combination of built in containers, extensive standard libraries and high level constructs allow for clear, compact code: code which fits in your head.
</p>

<h2>Easy to Write</h2>
<p>I can write Python code which is free of syntax errors and which does what I want. Of course it helps that I&#8217;ve been actively using the language for 15 years, but I&#8217;ve been using C++ for longer and still make mistakes with it: ask me to declare a pointer to a member function, for example, or to knock up a variadic template function, and I&#8217;ll need a moment or two.
</p>

<h2>Transparent</h2>
<p>I also consider C a simple language. C offers a transparent abstraction of a register machine, with a stack, a heap, and addressable memory. If you can imagine the operation of such a machine, you can figure out C. Python is less transparent but reveals its workings if pressed. Dicts form a part of the language seen by users, and under the hood they provide the dynamic context which supports a running program. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">read-eval-print loop</a> makes it easy to poke and reshape your program. You can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html">disassemble code</a> to see what the virtual machine sees.
</p>

<h2>Consistent improvement</h2>
<p>The language has got better since I first started using it. It has also got bigger, and this growth would, at first, seem at odds with simplicity. However, consider &#8212; as an example &#8212; the point when list comprehensions were introduced. Language support for building a list from an iterable results in compact declarative code. Simple code. What&#8217;s more, the square brackets which now delimit list comprehensions are the same square brackets that were previously used to delimit lists. The syntax may have been new but it didn&#8217;t surprise. Now consider the introduction of set and dict comprehensions, which follow logically and naturally from list comprehensions, almost as if they were discovered rather than invented.
</p>
<p>There are many other examples where additions to the language have unified and simplified.
</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not a Python insider and cannot comment on the exact balance of benevolence and dictatorship which goes into the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/">language enhancement process</a>. I would say Python doesn&#8217;t suffer from being designed by a committee. It sticks to its strengths and its direction, to its vision.

<p>A friend asked for help reaching the next level of a puzzle game. The test which stalled her involves machine placement in a sausage factory.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; each sausage was branded with a letter for quality control purposes, thus:
   <strong>ypbtkizfgxptclcoirdsuhjwulqkoszrabfc</strong>
</p>
<p>The string was then drawn through seven machines which rearranged the sausages in flavour enhancing ways.
</p>
<p><strong>Machine A: The Reversifier</strong>
</p>
<p>Reverses the order of the sausages, so they get tastier as you go along.
</p>
<p>&#8230;
</p>
<p><strong>Machine G: Secondhalffirstifier</strong>
</p>
<p>move the second half of the string to the beginning, as the earlier sausages are too spicy to eat early in the morning.
</p>
<p>He attached these machines in a certain sequence, though one of them was out for repair so only six were used. He then fed a string of sausages through and was surprised to discover the string that came out at the other end said <strong>lickyourlips</strong>. What order were the machines in?
</p>
</blockquote><p>It&#8217;s nicely phrased, but what&#8217;s really wanted is the sequence of simple transformations that takes input &#8220;ypbtkizfgxptclcoirdsuhjwulqkoszrabfc&#8221; and produces output &#8220;lickyourlips&#8221;.

<p>It&#8217;s no doubt possible to work backwards and figure out a solution using no more than logic, pencil and paper. For example, only two of the machines change the length of the string, and &#8212; looking at the before and after lengths &#8212; these must both be used. It&#8217;s rather easier to write a short program to find a solution.
</p>
<p>First we must simulate the seven sausage machines, A-G, which perform the following sequence operations.
</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>reverse the order of a sequence</li>
<li>remove every other element of a sequence</li>
<li>remove every third element of a sequence</li>
<li>pairwise reverse elements of a sequence</li>
<li>move even numbered elements to the front of a sequence</li>
<li>move the last element of a sequence to the front</li>
<li>swap the front and back half of a sequence</li>
</ol>

<p>None of these is difficult, especially in a high-level language which builds in support for sequence operations. What I found noteworthy is that a solution can be found without any <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html">loops or if statements</a>. What&#8217;s more, every operation can handled using nothing more than <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">slice operations</a>.
</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my solution. The machines consist of slice operations, helped by a couple of conditional expressions and recursive calls. The solution can then be brute-forced: there are only 5040 ways of permuting 6 out of 7 machines.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/wordaligned/a04308eac7ee2aa37e01.js"></script>

<p>I&#8217;ve used <code>reduce</code> to apply a chain of functions to a string of sausages &#8212; an explicit loop might be clearer, but I want a loop-free solution. For this same reason I use recursion in the pairwise swapper and the element dropper. Generally in Python, recursion is a poor choice. In this case I know I&#8217;m starting with a string of just 36 elements which cannot get any longer; there&#8217;s no risk of exceeding the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getrecursionlimit">system recursion limit</a>.
</p>
<p>The sequence reversal <code>s[::-1]</code> is idiomatic but alarming to the uninitiated. Slices have <code>[start:stop:stride]</code> fields, any of which may be defaulted. Usually <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code> default to the start and end of the sequence, but in this case the negative stride reverses them.
</p>
<p>To rotate the last element of a sequence to the front, prefer:
</p>
<pre><code>return s[-1:] + s[:-1]
</code></pre><p>to:
</p>
<pre><code>return [s[-1]] + s[:-1]
</code></pre><p>because the latter raises an <code>IndexError</code> for an empty sequence.
</p>
<p>Slicing is a formidable tool for sequence manipulation, especially when combined with the option of using negative indices to count back from the end. Slices allow you to reverse, rotate and partition sequences, to pairwise swap elements, and to drop every nth element.
</p>
<p>The miniature recipes presented here don&#8217;t even use slice assignment, which gives me an excuse to reproduce this elegant prime sieve function, which does.

</blockquote><p>Code formatting tools are nothing new but Go notches them up a level. Your Go installation comes with an automated formatter, <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">gofmt</a>, and this tool has been used to layout the entire code base. As a result, Go code looks uniform and familiar. The recommendation is to gofmt your own code, ideally on save and certainly before submitting for review.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

</div>

<p><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html">Formatting tools for other languages</a> require configuration. You must instruct the tool about your preferences for spaces and braces. Gofmt is inflexible and this is a strength.
</p>
<p>The language designers did Go a favour by supplying and promoting gofmt early on, before alternative style guides had been developed and adopted. There can be no more arguments about tabs vs spaces, for example. Code reviews must focus on content rather than layout.
</p>
<p>There are also more subtle benefits. Certain kinds of manual layout are fragile: the insertion of space to vertically align assignment statements, for example. A code formatter gets it right every time.
</p>

<h2><a href="#toc1" name="tocgo-knows-best" id="tocgo-knows-best">Go knows best</a></h2>
<p>As writers &#8212; and programmers are, fundamentally, <a href="http://wordaligned.org/articles/lessons-from-the-oulipo">writers</a> &#8212; maybe we don&#8217;t want our work to look uniform or familiar. Maybe we prefer more control over what we produce. Maybe sometimes, we&#8217;d like to surprise or provoke.
</p>
<p>Does the regularity gofmt imposes render our code bland, even boring?
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard this point extended to be a criticism of Go in general: that the language restricts what you can do because the language designers know best, and that it&#8217;s for your own good.
</p>
<p>Well, if I&#8217;ve ever submitted extravagently formatted code for review, it&#8217;s been slapped back. Substantial programs are developed by teams who adopt idiom and share style rules for good reason. It&#8217;s how we work together. Imagine how much easier it would be if the third party code in your code base was also written to your preferred style. Go gives you that, so long as you prefer its native style.
</p>
<p>Gofmt does not completely over-ride a programmer&#8217;s choices. Two programs which are semantically identical but laid out differently will probably still be laid out differently after a pass through gofmt.

<p>Clients of the function supply a visitor, <code>vis</code>, which is called back as vertices and edges are discovered and classified. These callbacks are carefully placed on the right hand side, visually distinguishing the core traversal from associated events.

<div class="atomentry" id="sledgehammers-vs-nut-crackers">
<h2 class="title"><a href="/articles/sledgehammers-vs-nut-crackers">Sledgehammers vs Nut Crackers</a></h2>
<p class="meta"><abbr class="published" title="2016-02-23">2016-02-23</abbr> &bull; <a href="/tag/awk" rel="tag">Awk</a>, <a href="/tag/python" rel="tag">Python</a> &bull; <a href="/articles/sledgehammers-vs-nut-crackers#disqus_thread">Comments</a></p>
<h2>Awk</h2>
<p>I get awk and can read awk programs but find the language of little use. Its focus is narrow and its syntax can be surprising. Python matches it at home and smashes it away. Nonetheless, a number of the <a href="./advent-of-code">advent of code</a> puzzles fit the awk processing model &#8212; line based instructions, the interpretation of which builds state contributing to the final result &#8212; and I enjoyed writing awk solutions. There&#8217;s satisfaction in using a tool which is up to the job, no more and no less: in using a nutcracker, rather than a sledgehammer, to crack a nut.
</p>

<h2>Puzzle</h2>
<p>For example, the puzzle set on <a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/6">day 6</a> consists of a list of instructions for switching and toggling a 1000 x 1000 grid of lights. The instructions read:
</p>
<pre><code>turn on 296,50 through 729,664
turn on 212,957 through 490,987
toggle 171,31 through 688,88
turn off 991,989 through 994,998
....
</code></pre><p>and the question is, after following these instructions, <strong>how many lights are lit</strong>?
</p>
<p>Each instruction is a single line; the actions &#8212; turn on, turn off, toggle &#8212; can be matched by patterns; and to follow these actions requires no more than an array and arithmetic: <code>awk</code> fits nicely.
</p>

<h2>Code</h2>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/wordaligned/ceb8671aad6a3416e094.js" type="text/javascript"></script>


<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Here, the <code>BEGIN</code> action sets the field separator <code>FS</code> to the regular expression <code>[ ,]</code> which picks out the textual and numeric fields from each instruction. Awk is highly dynamic: use a variable as a number and it becomes a number, in this case the coordinates of a lighting grid; and similarly, the fields &#8220;on&#8221;, &#8220;off&#8221; and &#8220;toggle&#8221; are matched and treated as strings.
</p>
<p>The grid of lights appears to be represented as a two dimensional array, accessed <code>lights[x,y]</code> rather than <code>lights[x][y]</code>. In fact, the array &#8212; like all arrays in awk &#8212; is an associative container, which maps from strings &#8212; not numbers &#8212; to values.  The key <code>x,y</code> becomes a string which joins the values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with a separator defaulted to <code>"\034"</code>.
</p>

<h2>Niggles</h2>
<p>The escape character at the end of line 5 is needed to continue the long line. I&#8217;d prefer to use parentheses to wrap the expression over more than one line, <a href="http://pep8.org/#indentation">as I would in Python</a>, but this trick doesn&#8217;t seem to work. I was somewhat surprised there was no built in <code>sum()</code> function to count up the number of lights turned on by the <code>END</code>. It would have been cute to pass <code>on()</code>, <code>off()</code> and <code>toggle()</code> as functions into <code>switch()</code>, separating traversal from action, but I couldn&#8217;t find a way to do this in awk.
</p>
<p>My awk script solved the puzzle in 45 seconds. A Python solution took 17 seconds. I didn&#8217;t try optimising either.

<h2>Don&#8217;t use a sledgehammer to crack a nut!</h2>
<p>This advice, commonly given to programmers, demands explanation. If it&#8217;s intended to imply a sledgehammer is more likely to pulverise the nut than open it, then fine, that&#8217;s true &#8212; but the analogy fails in this case: a solution written in Python would have been equally correct.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if we mean you shouldn&#8217;t use a powerful language when a less powerful one would do, then the question becomes: <strong>why not</strong>? Python is a general purpose programming language. It can crack nuts, peel bananas, serve web pages and so much more. If you know Python why bother with Awk?
</p>
<p>At the outset of this post I admitted I don&#8217;t generally bother with awk. Sometimes, though, I encounter the language and need to read and possibly adapt an existing script. So that&#8217;s one reason to bother. Another reason is that it&#8217;s elegant and compact. Studying its operation and motivation may help us compose and factor our own programs &#8212; programs far more substantial than the scripts presented here, and in which there will surely be places for mini-languages of our own.

<h2 class="title"><a href="/articles/code-reviews--the-rules">Code Reviews - the rules</a></h2>
<p class="meta"><abbr class="published" title="2015-08-05">2015-08-05</abbr> &bull; <a href="/tag/self" rel="tag">Self</a>, <a href="/tag/design" rel="tag">Design</a>, <a href="/tag/build" rel="tag">Build</a>, <a href="/tag/go" rel="tag">Go</a> &bull; <a href="/articles/code-reviews--the-rules#disqus_thread">Comments</a></p>
<p>The rule is: no code gets checked in without a review.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always easy to get a reviewer to sign off a changelist. Does the code build? In all configurations and on all platforms? Do the tests pass? Are all new code paths covered? Does the commit message describe the change? Does the formatting match the style guide? Does the code match its surroundings? How about documentation, compiler warnings, license requirements?
</p>
<p>Is the change really necessary? Could it have been realised more simply?
</p>
<p>Certainly the reviewer&#8217;s task is easier if the task has been <a href="/articles/programming-paired-and-shared">paired on</a>. Small and self-contained changelists are more straightforward. Removing code, too, should be less contentious.
</p>
<p>Depending on infrastructure, some checklist items can be automated. Ideally the changelist has already been though CI, for example, ticking the builds-cleanly and passes-its-tests boxes.
</p>
<p>So far, so what? (So obvious!)
</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another rule, and one I&#8217;ve not seen written down before.
</p>
<p>When I review code I might well consider how I would have made the change. That doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ll insist the submitter does things my way. In the absence of <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code" title="go fmt your code">automated formatters</a> there will be more than one acceptable way to lay out the code. Sometimes there&#8217;s little reason to prefer an explicit loop over an algorithm + lambda combination, or vice-versa. <a href="/articles/go-for-short-variable-names">Short names</a> work for me but not for everyone. It&#8217;s hard to argue against test coverage, but is more always better?
</p>
<p>In such cases I won&#8217;t try to impose my own style on the changelist. Instead, the question becomes: <strong>does the code match the standards we, as a team, have set</strong>? Or, <strong>do these changes merit a place in our codebase</strong>?
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple principle but not an obvious one. It helps me review fairly and also to learn from others on my team.
</p>
<p>There <strong>is</strong> more than one way to do it!
</p>

<p class="meta"><abbr class="published" title="2015-05-27">2015-05-27</abbr> &bull; <a href="/tag/self" rel="tag">Self</a>, <a href="/tag/emacs" rel="tag">Emacs</a>, <a href="/tag/design" rel="tag">Design</a> &bull; <a href="/articles/programming-paired-and-shared#disqus_thread">Comments</a></p>
<p>We <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair program</a> where I work. Two people, one desk. It can get intense.
</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28cleaning_product%29"><img style="align:top" src="/images/vim.jpg" alt="Floor cleaner"/></a>
   <a href="/articles/accidental-emacs"><img style="align:top" src="/images/gnu.jpg" alt="Emacs"/></a>
</p>
<p>Editor wars claim few casualties &mdash; until an emacs and a vim user are forced to share a keyboard and screen, that is. Anyone for notepad?
</p>
<p>Sharing the typing isn&#8217;t why we pair. Where I work we also do code reviews. Whilst pair programming is encouraged, code reviews are mandated: code cannot be checked in until approved by a reviewer. That reviewer could be the person you paired with, and it soon becomes apparent that reviews conducted with a pair go more smoothly than ones where the reviewer is new to the task. It&#8217;s hard for someone to review a tricky changeset without the context of its development.
</p>
<p>The <strong>context of its development</strong> turns out to be paramount for understanding a codebase, not just a changeset. Pair programming helps provide that context.
</p>
<p>The term <strong>pairing</strong> serves better than <strong>pair programming</strong>. The former suggests sharing; the latter, typing. The benefits come from sharing all aspects of the work: decisions and responsibility; research, design, development; how to test; where to cut corners and where to go beyond the immediate requirement; when to take a break. Anyone for table football?

<div class="atomentry" id="jokey-code">
<h2 class="title"><a href="/articles/jokey-code">Jokey Code?</a></h2>
<p class="meta"><abbr class="published" title="2015-05-11">2015-05-11</abbr> &bull; <a href="/tag/documentation" rel="tag">Documentation</a>, <a href="/tag/accu" rel="tag">ACCU</a> &bull; <a href="/articles/jokey-code#disqus_thread">Comments</a></p>
<h3>Choose Talks</h3>
<p>I usually leave it as late as possible before deciding which sessions to attend at the <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2015">ACCU conference</a>. There&#8217;s ample time to study the <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2015/accu2015_schedule">schedule</a> when you&#8217;re there and anyway, it&#8217;s subject to change.
</p>
<p>This year I stuck with this policy with a couple of notable exceptions. First, there was <a href="/docs/oulipo/">my own talk</a>, where I noted that computer programmers are writers who impose formal constraints on their texts, and who can learn from other writers who practice the same discipline. Second, there was Peter Hilton&#8217;s talk, <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2015/accu2015_sessions#how_to_name_things_-_the_hardest_problem_in_programming">&#8220;How to name things &#8212; the hardest problem in programming&#8221;</a>, in which he argued more generally that programmers had much to learn from writers.
</p>
<p>I <strong>had</strong> to see Peter Hilton&#8217;s talk and it did not disappoint. It engaged me at the time, in discussions afterwards, and it continues to make me think. I won&#8217;t post a full response here but I do want to consider one aspect: humour.
</p>
<div><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/qnND7jVVQOmWCS" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<h3>Tell Jokes</h3>
<p>Peter Hilton argued we should pay attention to tips from the likes of George Orwell and Stephen King because their advice is better written and also because it&#8217;s <strong>funnier</strong>. Why does this humourous aspect matter? Well, perhaps we&#8217;re more likely to listen to someone who makes us laugh. Witty advice sounds less pompous.
</p>
<p>It goes deeper than this, though. Another point from the talk:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Improve your general vocabulary. Read books, especially funny novels.
</p>
</blockquote><p>Why <strong>funny novels</strong>? At this point in the talk Peter Hilton disingenously suggested such books were easier to read. A point he made later goes deeper:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Tell jokes &#8230; Puns are important for naming, because they rely on double-meanings. Spotting double-meanings is the essential skill for avoiding ambiguous names.
</p>
</blockquote><p>Interesting! I agree that word play and word power are linked: but do you need to be a punster to avoid ambiguity? I&#8217;m not sure. In the words of <a href="http://chrisoldwood.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/the-daily-stand-up.html">Chris Oldwood</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been writing more functional code lately. I recently tried a few numerical recipes with currying functions, but all I got was a NaN.
</p>
</blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naan"><img src="/images/naan.jpg" alt="all I got was a NaN"/></a>
</p>

<h3>Laughable Code</h3>
<p>Is there a place for humour in code? Rarely, I&#8217;d say. Code is read,
   re-read and then read again: most jokes become tired and then
   irritating under such scrutiny. Peter Hilton, though, described his
   amusement on discovering this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pirhilton/how-to-name-things-the-hardest-problem-in-programming/55">function</a>, which configures
   and starts <a href="http://camel.apache.org/">Apache Camel</a>:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">/** Configure and start Apache Camel */
def mountCamel() {
    Logger.info("Starting Camel...")
    val context = new DefaultCamelContext()
    configuredRoutes foreach { route =&gt;
        context.addRoutes(route)
    }
    context.start()
}

</pre>

</div>

<p>The obvious alternative, <code>startCamel()</code>, just isn&#8217;t funny enough, apparently. I&#8217;m glad the author resisted the temptation to call it <code>humpCamel()</code>.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reminded of a colleague with a fondness for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franglais">franglais</a> who
   would, for example, check in a graphics routine called
   <code>do_le_render()</code>. Mildly amusing first time round, maybe, but less so
   each time it got revisited to fix les bugs.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ahmedrabea/7929947448" title="Ark of Desert - Camel by Ahmed Rabea, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/7929947448_06dd57700c_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Ark of Desert - Camel"/></a>
</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see many jokes in the code I read and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s
   because the authors lack a sense of humour. Just as <a href="/articles/entertaining-documentation" title="Entertaining documentation">good
documentation should inform rather than entertain</a>, good code
   should express complex ideas as plainly as possible: humour doesn&#8217;t
   get a look in.
</p>
<p>There are exceptions. We&#8217;ve already seen the name &#8220;camel&#8221; used for something which isn&#8217;t a camel: libraries, products and projects can benefit from short, memorable and quirky names. In unit tests, too, code is less complex, which can leave space for quips and in-jokes. When an integer is expected it often turns out to be <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?q=the%20answer%20to%20life%20the%20universe%20and%20everything">42</a>. Binary input data is laid out to form strange messages when viewed as <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/hexwords.html">hexadecimal</a>. If some text &#8212; any old text &#8212; is needed, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">lorem ipsum</a> would indicate a lack of imagination. Even so, well-chosen names and values from the domain under test would probably be more helpful when a failing test needs fixing.
</p>

<h3>Charming code</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m down on jokes in code but I do think code can be a pleasure to read and that well written programs can delight. Whilst I agree with Peter Hilton&#8217;s recommendation to read widely and well, I was surprised he didn&#8217;t recommend reading <strong>code</strong>, and when I discussed this with him afterwards he asked, where is it? Where is it! That will be the subject of another article, but off the top of my head, <a href="http://www.freetype.org">freetype</a>, <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>, <a href="http://llvm.org/">llvm</a>, the Go and Python standard libraries. If you read through any of these you&#8217;ll enjoy their clarity and internal consistency &#8212; their style; and should you code against them, these same attributes show through their interfaces.
</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t found any jokes in the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> source but if you decide
   to integrate it in your application, when you check the license you&#8217;ll
   find, instead, a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/different.html">blessing</a>. This may seem funny &#8212; unusual,
   certainly &#8212; but it&#8217;s actually quite serious.
</p>
<blockquote><p>May you do good and not evil<br/>
May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others<br/>
May you share freely, never taking more than you give.</p></blockquote>

<p>We may not issue blessings with our own code but maybe we can find other ways to surprise and delight.

<p>Did I mention that I&#8217;ve become scrum master for my team? I have now. It&#8217;s a new thing for me (and for this blog) but I enjoy it, especially running the retrospective meetings. You have to keep these fresh and one way of doing this is to connect them with what&#8217;s going on in the world outside: the <a href="http://plans-for-retrospectives.com/?id=54" title="Story Oscars, a retromat activity">Oscars</a>, the eclipse, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015">general election</a> &#8230;
</p>
<p style="margin:0;text-align:center;font-size:800%;">&#x2611;</p>

<p>With a week to go, my vote has been posted. So, here&#8217;s an activity I devised for a recent retrospective. We were focusing on infrastructure issues and trying to come with improvements. For this, it worked well.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Ask the team to split into three or four &#8220;political&#8221; parties. Each party must come up with a manifesto for change. What isn&#8217;t working? How would they improve things, given the chance? After 20 minutes of discussion, reconvene and ask the party leaders to present their manifesto to the electorate. Be prepared for tough questions and heckling!</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to plan a brighter future. Summarise the key points of each manifesto and write them up on sticky notes, using different colours for the different parties. What do the parties agree on? Which promises are unrealistic and which can be delivered?</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin:0;text-align:center;font-size:800%;">&#x2611;</p>

<p>For more retrospective ideas, I recommend <a href="http://plans-for-retrospectives.com" title="Retromat, plans for retrospectives">Retromat</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/findingmarbles" title="@findingmarbles">Corinna Baldauf</a>.

<p>This time last week I was on my way to the <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2015" title="ACCU 2015 main page">ACCU 2015 conference</a> in Bristol. The past couple of years I&#8217;ve been, but for one day only. This year, as a presenter of a full length (90 minute!) session I got to go to the whole thing.
</p>
<p>Being a speaker made all the difference. Having the chance to attend plenty of sessions meant I was more relaxed about choosing which ones to pick &#8212; each slot during the day offered <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2015/accu2015_schedule" title="ACCU 2015 Schedule">5 options</a> &#8212; and less upset if I thought, 10 minutes into a presentation, that I could have picked something else. Perhaps as a consequence of this, I was happy with all my choices. That said, I&#8217;d love the whole thing to run again so I could take a second route through the schedule.
</p>

<p>I&#8217;d run a couple of practice versions of my talk at ACCU local groups in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ACCU-Bristol">Bristol</a> and then in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ACCU-Oxford">Oxford</a>, which meant I was comfortable with the material and convinced it would hold an audience&#8217;s interest.
