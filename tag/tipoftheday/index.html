			This is the final picture I drew in this sketchbook (show
            sketchbook). We saw a friend in San Francisco then flew to
            Mexico City and travelled overland down through central
            america to leave from Costa Rica. Even though I drew this
            22 years ago I remember being there. If you draw something
            you engage with it, you remember it.

			My most important tip is: DRAW. Keep doing it and you will
            have a book.  It will show progression, it will tell a
            story. It will be greater than the sum of its parts.

			I guess the fact I have this picture shows I was
            encouraged in any creative exercise. I still am!  I sent
            my parents a self-portrait recently & they are delighted
            with it. My mother makes it clear I copied this from a
            book.

			Whereas this is from imagination. As Lee could tell you, it's the hydra,
            a mythical beast slain by Heracles. Cut one head off and two grow back!

			The human form is one of the hardest things to draw.  The
            teacher will not tell you how to draw, but being with
            other people doing the same thing accelerates learning.

            What you leave out is important. Some media (charcoal)
            allow you to draw by removing.
