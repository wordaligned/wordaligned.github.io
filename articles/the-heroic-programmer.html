<p>I recently chanced on a series of articles by <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com">Dave Thomas</a> on
his approach to <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/writing_a_book/index.html">writing a book</a>. I first came across Dave
Thomas and co-author Andy Hunt when I read <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">&#8220;The Pragmatic Programmer:
From Journeyman to Master&#8221;</a> &#8212; a book which I rate as one of the
best general programming titles &#8212; so I read the articles with interest.</p>
<p><span id="continue-reading"/></p>
<h3 id="the-heros-journey">The Hero&#8217;s Journey</h3>
<p>In the <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/2007/03/sywtwab_2_the_h.html">second article</a> Thomas suggests that all good technical books
tell the same story, that of the hero&#8217;s journey: just as Odysseus
had to overcome a sequence of monsters on his way home from
the battle of Troy, so the modern reader must undertake a similar
voyage. In Thomas&#8217;s own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reader joins the book already faced with a major challenge &#8212;
they need to learn some new technique or technology. They need to
make a commitment to follow the path. Along the way, they need to
learn stuff, try things, conquering increasingly difficult concepts
and challenges. Eventually they graduate; they&#8217;ve learned what they
came to learn. But they journey doesn&#8217;t end there. Like the hero,
they then have to come home, bringing back what they learned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might seem strange to find anything heroic in, for example,
<a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/textmate/index.html">learning how to use an editor</a> however powerful that editor might
be, but I agree with <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com">Thomas</a>&#8217;s point: compelling technical writing
should tell a story. Should that story always fit the hero&#8217;s journey
archetype? I&#8217;m less sure <a href="#footnote"><a href="/articles/a-tale-of-two-upgrades.html">1</a></a>, but it&#8217;s certainly a pattern
I&#8217;ve often (subconsciously) used myself.</p>
<h3 id="flawed-heroes">Flawed Heroes</h3>
<p>Unlike Odysseus, modern literary heroes are flawed. They don&#8217;t have
superhuman powers and their story doesn&#8217;t always end happily ever after.
Modern technical authors understand this. You can&#8217;t teach anyone how
to <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">program in 21 days</a> and a reader would be right to suspect a book
which makes such a claim. The language used in the design patterns
literature acknowledges this element of compromise explicitly: a
solution to a problem emerges from conflicting forces, and will have
consequences.</p>
<p>Similarly <span id="excerpt0"/>&#8220;pragmatic&#8221; is hardly a quality traditionally associated
with heroism, yet it is the prominent word in the title of Thomas and
Hunt&#8217;s most famous book, and indeed in their publishing
business. Software development isn&#8217;t really about perfection, it&#8217;s
about resolving problems and reaching working solutions; and by doing
this well, perhaps we too can be <a href="http://www.lyricsdownload.com/stranglers-no-more-heroes-lyrics.html">heroes</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><a id="footnote"><a href="/articles/a-tale-of-two-upgrades.html">1</a></a>
There&#8217;s much comedy, pathos and failure to be found in the real world
of software development, and even the occasional tragedy &#8212; perhaps
these stories aren&#8217;t appropriate for <em>technical</em> books, but they&#8217;re well
worth telling. Certainly much software development could be
characterised as farce: the repetition of the same old jokes and
pratfalls.</p>

<p>Hi (I am a CVu reader and Word Aligned lurker).</p>

<p>Odysseus didn't have any superhuman powers - he wasn't a hero in the Greek sense of being half divine (eg Achilles), in the Greek sense he was an anti-hero - just a human.  His only powers were his intellect and guile.  To that extent he's quite a good model of the human overcoming challenges.</p>

<p>The problem (for me) with using the Odyssey as a metaphor for the programmer's journey is that Odysseus doesn't actually learn anything from his adventures: putting aside the opening and closing sequences, you could read the Wanderings episodes in any order you like with no effect on the overall narrative.</p>

<p>A better literary metaphor would be the bildungsroman, which follows the hero's development from childhood to maturity.  Unfortunately the ones I know all end rather badly (Sorrows of Young Werther, Portrait of the Artist), or are incoherent (Tristram Shandy, In Search of Lost Time).  Maybe there's a lesson in that.  I haven't read Great Expectations.</p>

<p>Best wishes</p>

<p>Ivan</p>

<p>Hi Ivan. Thanks for de-lurking. Just to make sure there's no confusion, Dave Thomas merely talks about the hero's journey -- I'm the one who introduces the Odyssey as an example of a story which I understood to fit this archetype. </p>

<p>You're quite right, Odysseus is human: he's not super-strong, super-fast, or in possession of magical powers; he's just unusually cunning, and also I suppose a good leader. I do recall, though, that only he is strong enough to string his bow, and he single-handedly uses it to slaughter all his wife's suitors when he returns to his palace. </p>

<p>Maybe there are literary archetypes which fit better, or perhaps the Odyssey doesn't quite fit the hero/programmer's journey template. These ideas are well worth discussing, but I wouldn't want to push them too hard. I'm going to <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bildungsroman" rel="nofollow">google bildungsromans</a> now and see if I've read any!</p>

<p>Sorry for the false accusation.  Odysseus is a good rôle-model - he's certainly pragmatic.</p>

<p>I just googled for "Hero's Journey": did you know that for £99 you can buy the complete 188-step plan? (<a href="http://www.clickok.co.uk/ClassicHero.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickok.co.uk/ClassicHero.html</a>; actually for sitcom writers).</p>

<p>Essential to the Hero's Journey is attainment of the final goal and becoming a hero.  Perhaps the bildungsroman developed partly in opposition to that focus: the goal is illusory; the journey itself is more important; "it is better to travel hopefully, ...".  </p>

<p>It seems to me that programmers are exactly in this tension: we have to act as if perfect design and bugless code are our goal, but we know that these things are probably beyond us and maybe even impossible in principle.</p>

<p>Perhaps the programmers equivalent of 'living The Good Life' is not to try and eradicate imperfections, but to develop 'gratia artis' and to find a place in our lives for the inevitable misfortunes (bugs, design flaws, lost contracts, etc.).  Of course, you wouldn't say that to the clients.</p>
