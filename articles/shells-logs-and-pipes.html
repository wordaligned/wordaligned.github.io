<p>I needed to make sense of a lengthy log file. The server had been
running over the weekend and the log file showed an increasing packet
error count.  (Don&#8217;t worry what a packet error is, it doesn&#8217;t really
matter as far as this post goes).  This post explains how the standard
Unix tools helped me dissect the log file, and indeed any other log
file.</p>
<p><span id="continue-reading"/></p>
<h3 id="heads-and-tails">Heads and Tails</h3>
<p>First, I needed the initial and final error counts.</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Initial and final error counts</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ head logfile | grep "packet errors"
Info: Fri 17:34:05, packet errors: 0
$ tail logfile | grep "packet errors"
Info: Mon 08:32:11, packet errors: 11323

</pre>

</div>

<p>So what exactly had gone wrong, and when? Paging through the filtered output
would take some time since the number of reported packet error counts
ran to five figures.</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Paging through the filtered output</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ grep "packet errors" logfile | less

</pre>

</div>

<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">How many errors were reported?</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ grep "packet errors" logfile | wc -l
125220

</pre>

</div>

<h3 id="uniq">Uniq</h3>
<p>Part of the problem was that whatever logged the message simply
printed out the error count every couple of seconds, whether or not
this error count had changed. Going back to Friday, reconfiguring
the logger and re-running the experiment wasn&#8217;t an option, but luckily
I had too much information rather than too little: all I had to do was
process it correctly.</p>
<p>What looked more useful was filtering just the lines at which the
error count had changed. Filtering out repeated lines using <code>uniq</code>
wouldn&#8217;t work, since every line&#8217;s timestamp made it unique. Happily,
<code>uniq</code> has an option to ignore a specified number of fields.</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Finding when the error count changed</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ grep "packet errors" logfile | uniq -f 3

</pre>

</div>

<p>Piping this command to <code>wc -l</code> indicated that the number of
interesting lines had been thinned down to around three thousand &#8212;
the kind of report which could be paged through comfortably enough.</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Counting error count changes</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ grep "packet errors" logfile | uniq -f 3 | wc -l
3432

</pre>

</div>

<h3 id="sort">Sort</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible to home in on other points of
interest. For example, we could investigate the maximum period of
stability by finding when the error count doesn&#8217;t change for
longest. This can be done using the <code>-c</code> option to <code>uniq</code>, which
precedes each output line with a count of the the number of times that
line was repeated in the input; then sorting using this count field as
a numeric key; then picking the last output value from the
pipeline.</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Locating the most stable period</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ grep "packet errors" logfile | \
  uniq -f 3 -c | sort -k1 -n | tail -1
    277 Info: Sat 23:00:15, packet errors: 4645

</pre>

</div>

<p>This tells us that on Saturday evening the error count remained stable
for longest &#8212; in fact, an error count of 4645 repeated 277 times
in the logfile, a duration of just 9 minutes (given that the packet
error count repeated every couple of seconds).</p>
<h3 id="et-cetera">Et cetera</h3>
<p>This is just a flavour of what the Unix shell tools can do when piped
together. We&#8217;ve combined some simple tools (<code>less</code>,
<code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>wc</code>, <code>grep</code>) into complex and powerful commands
using just a few keystrokes. Imagine trying to design a GUI which
would allow you to analyse a log file as shown above. <span id="excerpt0"/>Now try
designing a GUI which can analyse any log file ever.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t pretend the Unix shell tools are user-friendly. In fact some
are distinctly arcane (<code>find</code> comes to mind). When I started out, I
found the Unix manual difficult to use, and although <code>info</code> has
improved things it&#8217;s still hard to find out about a command without
knowing its name. And if there&#8217;s a decent, hyper-linked online
reference, I&#8217;ve yet to find it.</p>
<h3 id="extending-the-toolset">Extending the Toolset</h3>
<p>Shell tools aren&#8217;t always capable of even the kind of text processing
described in this article. For example, if the logfile had more
structure to it &#8212; or even was written out as XML &#8212; then we&#8217;d
probably be find ourselves struggling.  Fortunately a scripting
language is very happy to help out in such cases. Perl remains a good
choice, if it&#8217;s one-liners you like. <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> are
better for longer-lived scripts.</p>
<p>Equally, there&#8217;s a point at which you need to convert text into
something more visual &#8212; a graph or a histogram, perhaps. Text
processing can be used to generate a format suitable for importing
into a <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">plotting</a> package.</p>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3>
<p>A Unix expert once told me that the difference between a Unix expert
and a non-expert wasn&#8217;t aptitude or years of accumulated knowledge
&#8212; rather it came down to a willingness to read carefully through the
manual.  I&#8217;m no expert, but regard this as sound advice.</p>
<p>For more on the Unix philosophy, and how it applies to software
development in general, I recommend <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/">&#8220;The Art of Unix Programming&#8221;</a> by
