</div><p>There&#8217;s an interesting shootout between various programming languages
   going on <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">here</a>. Rather than argue in general about the
   relative merits of programming languages, this site measures them up
   in terms of the resources they consume performing various simple
   tasks.  I like the way they&#8217;ve side-stepped the language bigots
   using this practical, experimental approach; though of course we have to
   be careful when we analyse the results.
</p>
<p>The headline figures and rankings are what the site concentrates on:
   <span id="excerpt0"/>the shootout is all about who&#8217;s got the fastest gun, rather than who&#8217;s
   the most accurate.
</p>
<span id="continue-reading"/>


<h4><a href="#toc0" name="tocsame-job-different-languages" id="tocsame-job-different-languages">Same job, different languages</a></h4>
<p>If we dig a little deeper, there&#8217;s a huge amount of interest here in
   comparing other facets of different languages. Getting the job done
   isn&#8217;t just about writing the program. What do you need to do
   to run it? How accurate is it? How robust? How extensible?
</p>

<h4><a href="#toc1" name="tocaccumulating-integers-using-c" id="tocaccumulating-integers-using-c">Accumulating integers using C</a></h4>
<p>One of the simplest example tasks is to calculate the <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/debian/benchmark.php?test=sumcol&amp;lang=all">sum</a> of the
   entries in a file containing a single column of signed integers. It&#8217;s
   the kind of job you might expect C to do well, and the
   <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/debian/benchmark.php?test=sumcol&amp;lang=gcc">C implementation</a>
   does indeed rank very highly in terms of CPU use and
   memory consumption &#8212; the entry even compiles cleanly.

<p>The <code>std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);</code> function call was a new

<p>To our C programmer, this expressive little program may seem
   obscure. Where&#8217;s the loop to sum the integers? In fact, where are the
   integers coming from anyway? It&#8217;s true, there&#8217;s a lot beneath the surface of
   this high-level code, and without some understanding of the primitive
   elements, writing such code can be difficult and risky.
</p>

<h4><a href="#toc3" name="tochighlevel-code-lowlevel-errors" id="tochighlevel-code-lowlevel-errors">High-level code, Low-level errors</a></h4>
<p>How can it be difficult to write such simple code? Here&#8217;s an example:
   the <code>eos</code> parameter is a default constructed input stream integer
   iterator. A C++ novice might have tried to indicate default
   construction like this.

<p>Sadly, this is fairly typical of the compile errors when you call

</p>

<h4><a href="#toc4" name="tocaccumulating-integers-using-c-style-python" id="tocaccumulating-integers-using-c-style-python">Accumulating integers using C style Python</a></h4>
<p>C++ is one descendant of C. <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is another. Both languages support
   a number of higher level idioms &#8212; generic programming, object
   oriented programming, functional programming &#8212; while retaining some
   level of C compatibility. We can accumulate integers in Python like this.
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">C-style Python accumulator</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">import sys
total = 0
for line in sys.stdin.readlines():
    total += int(line)
print total

</pre>

</div>

<p>What we gain in readability, and indeed ease of coding, we lose in
   efficiency. This code is an order of magnitude more wasteful than the
   C solution. The <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">shootout</a> also presents a more Pythonic
   <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/debian/benchmark.php?test=sumcol&amp;lang=python">solution</a>.
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">A more Pythonic integer accumulator</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">import sys, itertools
print sum(itertools.imap(int, sys.stdin))

</pre>

</div>

<p>Here, <code>sum</code> is a built-in generic function to add up the elements of a
   collection (where the collection can be, as in this case, an iterable
   object), and <code>itertools.imap</code> is what generates that collection by
   applying <code>int</code> to each element of <code>sys.stdin</code>. Note that when a file,
   such as <code>sys.stdin</code>, appears in an iterable context, the lines of that
   file are what will be iterated over.
</p>
<p>We could do without <code>itertools</code> and simply use the built-in <code>map</code>.
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">A smaller Python integer accumulator</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">import sys
print sum(map(int, sys.stdin))

</pre>

</div>

<p>The difference is that this version will build the whole collection in
   memory before summing its elements (which, on the 6Kb input file, is
   actually fractionally faster on my Python implementation).
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite this elegance, the Python solution remains an order of
   magnitude more wasteful than both the C and C++ solutions. Nonetheless,
   it&#8217;s better in other important respects.
</p>

<h4><a href="#toc5" name="toccorrectness" id="toccorrectness">Correctness</a></h4>
<p>Computers are incredibly quick at accumulating
   integers. It&#8217;s not a tricky problem, in contrast to, say, mapping out
   a <a href="http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/">traveling salesman&#8217;s itinerary</a>, or
   stacking crates in a warehouse.
</p>
<p>If we <em>really</em> care about the speed of our integer
   accumulator, it&#8217;s probably because we have a very long list of input
   numbers. In C, which is often described as portable assembler, an
   integer is actually just a word on the machine &#8212; and is therefore constrained
   to fit in a fixed number of bytes (4, typically, possibly as few as
   2), giving a large-ish but finite range of values. Assuming
   <code>sizeof(int)</code> is 4, the maximum integer value is 2 <em></em> 31 - 1, which is
   2147483647.
</p>
<p>What will 2147483647 + 1 be? Not 2147483648 &#8212; that won&#8217;t fit in 4
   bytes.  The actual result will depend on your implementation, but it
   certainly won&#8217;t be right. Most likely, the program will run as usual
   and will politely offer a vaguely convincing but <em>wrong</em> result.
   This is dangerous behaviour.
</p>
<p>C++ advocates believe static typing is there to protect them from
   programming errors, and even that the compiler traps bugs before a
   program can even be run. I&#8217;ve come to regard static typing as a way of
   strapping code more tightly to the machine: great for
   <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">shootouts</a>, but less useful for flexible and correct programs.
</p>
<p><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> provides a higher-level model of integers. (Is the word &#8220;model&#8221;
   correct in this context? The model of an integer is just an integer,
   an unbounded one.) Python integers don&#8217;t overflow.  So the Python
   program can accumulate any sum of any integers which will fit on the machine.
</p>

<h4><a href="#toc6" name="tocrobustness" id="tocrobustness">Robustness</a></h4>
<p>So, both C++ programs only cope with bounded integers and sums. They
   aren&#8217;t much use when the input is malformed either, and their responses
   differ. For example, if our input file contains commas, like this:
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">malformed input 1</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">276,
498,
-981,
770,
...

</pre>

</div>

<p>then our C style C++ will ignore the commas and just sum the numbers,
   whilst our idiomatic C++ stops when it hits the first comma and
   produces the result <code>276</code>. Neither C++ variant draws attention to the
   unexpected input. Similarly, if the input file contained an unexpected
   floating point number:
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">malformed input 2</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">276
498
-98.1
770
...

</pre>

</div>

<p>then the C++ implementations yield different answers. I&#8217;ll leave it to you
   to figure out how they process the unexpected value.
</p>
<p>Politely producing an answer which is not obviously wrong is, as I&#8217;ve
   said, dangerous. The Python program doesn&#8217;t know what to do either, so,
   in both cases it fails safely by raising an error.
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Python response to malformed input</div>

<h4><a href="#toc7" name="toclast-one-standing" id="toclast-one-standing">Last one standing</a></h4>

<p>Fair point, but I'm not sure how well the analogy works. Of course the shootout is all about efficiency, but the sample programs I compare are idiomatic solutions to the problem of accumulating integers, and I'm interested in their other dimensions. In fact, the shootout refuses non-idiomatic solutions, otherwise we'd probably see performance hacks like loop-unrolling and embedded assembler instructions -- and of course the Python would simply call out to C (which would use loop-unrolling and embedded assembler ... ).</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Instead of complaining about programs, as though they were writ in stone - contribute a better program."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good point. I should. And thanks for the correction on file sizes -- I'd missed that. Things make a little more sense now :-)</p>

<p>Re- Haskell. I know little about Haskell, but I have hopes that functional languages are going to move further into the mainstream with the increase of multi-core chips. Accumulating a huge collection of integers is a task well-suited to divide and conquer: spawn tasks to accumulate portions of the collection, then sum their individual results. What I really don't want to see is programmers hand-coding threads to do this: it leads to horrendous code and hideous defects. I'd like the language to quietly and correctly tune the code for me.</p>

<p>It's true, not everything is as easy to measure as speed (and we all know how hard it is to get meaningful speed measurements); and it's also true that automatically generated metrics are valuable. </p>

<p>My favourite such metric would be: <em>"how many tests does it pass?"</em> The <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org" rel="nofollow">shootout</a> already has this covered. I think the shootout also has some interesting things to tell us about: <em>"how do I run it?"</em> and: <em>"what happens when the computer doesn't like it (e.g. what do the compile errors look like)?"</em>. These details are incidental to the shootout, and harder to quantify.</p>

<p>Similarly, it's hard to objectively measure: <em>"how readable is it?"</em> For example, I'm used to (e.g.) Java programmers claiming that  a long list of imports, keywords, type declarations and getters and setters make a program easier to read. I disagree! For me, the lines-of-code metric would be more closely correlated to readability. Again, the shootout sort-of covers this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because we haven't yet said what we mean by "readable". We might imagine "readable" could be measured by asking many many programmers questions about the program, and measuring their response time and accuracy.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Java programmers ... imports, keywords, type declarations and ... make a program easier to read. I disagree!</p>

<p>My opinion is that both those responses are too simplistic - it depends. It depends how big the program is, it depends how complex the program is, it depends on the skill and experience of the readers (and writers), it depends what browse/explore tools are available in the programming environment ...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And see how naive the implementation is - a simple recursive function that takes a handle and sum as arguments, and loops until no more ints are read - in this case, congratulations to the language implementors.</p>
