<h3 id="caging-the-effects-monster">Caging the Effects Monster</h3>
<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/"><img src="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/GIFs/spj-snow.jpg" alt="Simon Peyton Jones in the snow" style="float:right;"/></a></p>
<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/">Simon Peyton Jones</a> gave an outstanding <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2008/accu2008_sessions#Caging%20the%20Effects%20Monster:%20the%20next%20decade's%20big%20challenge">keynote</a> on functional programming at <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2008">ACCU 2008</a>. A language researcher at Microsoft in Cambridge, he&#8217;s perhaps best known as the man behind the <a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a> programming language and <a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>, the leading Haskell compiler. He also happens to be a superb presenter who positively exudes enthusiasm. <span id="excerpt0"/>Not many compiler writers connect so well with an audience.</p>
<p><span id="continue-reading"/></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of a functional programming <em>style</em>, by which I mean I like first class functions, higher order functions, anonymous functions, list comprehensions, closures and so on. In the languages I use most often, <a href="/tags/c++">C++</a>, <a href="/tags/python">Python</a> and <a href="/tags/shell">Shell</a>, functional programming is a central paradigm &#8212; every bit as useful and important as object-oriented and procedural programming.</p>
<p>For Haskell and other pure functional languages it&#8217;s not just about style. Simon Peyton Jones&#8217; central argument was that <span id="excerpt1"/>programming will increasingly be about the control of side-effects: to write correct programs, side-effects must be contained. A pure function has <strong>no</strong> side-effects. Thus you can be sure what it does. You can even <strong>prove</strong> it correct. A pure program built entirely from pure functions is equally correct but, sadly, of limited use. Haskell&#8217;s type system distinguishes pure functions from impure ones &#8212; the ones which change the world. If you minimise and contain impurity, you&#8217;re winning!</p>
<p><img src="/images/the-challenge-of-effects.jpg" alt="The challenge of effects"/></p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly a compelling argument. In the languages I use from day to day, as already mentioned, I favour a functional style. I also adopt value-based programming (sometimes known as single assignment programming &#8212; once you&#8217;ve set something, you don&#8217;t change it) as far as possible: it&#8217;s easier to figure out what a program does, and you can avoid a whole class of defects. Simon Peyton Jones describes my approach as &#8220;Plan A&#8221;, the mainstream route towards writing programs which are both useful and safe. He promotes &#8220;Plan B&#8221;, a more radical approach, where &#8220;useless&#8221; languages like Haskell find ways to change the world.</p>
<h3 id="strong-static-typing">Strong Static Typing</h3>
<p>Static type checking is central to Haskell and the language comes with a rich type system allowing static analysis and compile-time checking. It&#8217;s the type system which determines, rigorously, which parts of a program have side-effects. Unlike C++, the type system doesn&#8217;t seem to get in the way. A lot more is inferred. In fact, some type declarations are unnecessary since the compiler could deduce them from the code &#8212; but in Haskell type declarations, at least for module exports, are seen as a good thing. </p>
<p>I found this interesting. Although I like dynamic languages I also like strong typing (yes, you can have both). In theory, static strong typing would be best of all; you eliminate the bug before you run the code. My experience with languages like C++ and Java have caused me to kick against this theory. The C++ type system just seems to get in your way: by the time you&#8217;ve <a href="/articles/koenigs-first-rule-of-debugging.html#a-problem-on-line-106">wrestled the compiler into submission</a> and got a program you can actually run you&#8217;ve worked so hard you feel like it <em>must</em> be good, when actually you&#8217;d have been better off running, testing, revising the code in an iterative manner. You&#8217;d certainly have had more fun! Haskell, though, may cause me to revise my opinion once again. It may indeed offer the benefits of strong static typing without the baggage.</p>
<h3 id="a-taste-of-haskell">A Taste of Haskell</h3>
<p><a href="http://haskell.org"><img src="http://haskell.org/wikistatic/haskellwiki_logo.png" alt="Haskell wiki logo" style="float:right;"/></a></p>
<p>In the afternoon I attended Simon Peyton Jones&#8217; <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2008/accu2008_sessions#A%20Taste%20of%20Haskell">&#8220;Taste of Haskell&#8221;</a> tutorial, which went into Haskell in more depth. The room was packed and people had to be turned away. Although I have written and read some Haskell I know very little about it, and three hours training with the world expert on the subject haven&#8217;t really altered that. Nonetheless, I&#8217;d like to record my first impressions here. They may all turn out to be wrong!</p>
<ul>
<li>I still maintain <a href="/articles/from-hash-key-to-haskell.html">Haskell could do with proper characters</a> for arrows, lambda, forall, function composition and so on. And guess what: GHC does indeed support Unicode, so you <em>can</em> write a program which uses &#x2200; instead of <code>forall</code>, for example. All you have to do is figure out how to input these characters.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not a minimal language, unlike, say, Scheme; there&#8217;s a lot of syntactic sugar, a deliberate decision, but nonetheless a concern. It will take a while before I get used to the syntax even if the concepts seem clear.</li>
<li>Most (possibly all?) functions take a single argument; so a function taking two arguments is actually a one-argument function which returns another one-argument function.</li>
<li>You can write your own infix operators and set their precedence.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be frightened by <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html">Monads</a>. They should really be called &#8220;warm fluffy things&#8221;.</li>
<li>Haskell is, by default, lazily evaluated. So it elegantly solves all the <a href="/tag/streams/">stream-based</a> puzzles I&#8217;ve been posing on this site. What was new to me was the suggestion that lazy evaluation somehow removes the need for Lisp-style macros. I wonder <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/info/6en91/comments/">what&#8217;s meant by this</a>?</li>
<li>Perhaps Haskell remains a vehicle for programming language research as well as for practical application. <a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a> provides many extensions to the Haskell 98 standard, to the extent that some extensions have effectively become standard.</li>
<li>The best book about Haskell hasn&#8217;t been finished yet. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">&#8220;Real World Haskell&#8221;</a> and it&#8217;s being written collaboratively.</li>
