<h3>How the Python became</h3>
<p>Guido van Rossum had a problem: <a href="http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/01/personal-history-part-1-cwi.html">what to call his new language</a>? Computer language names often tip a hat to their predecessors, as <strong>Ruby</strong> does to <strong>Perl</strong>, for example. In this case the immediate predecessor, <strong>ABC</strong>, had itself changed from <i><b>B</b></i> because it got mistaken for <strong>B</strong>, and the suggestion ABC &#8220;made programming easy as ABC&#8221; failed to convince Guido. So he dropped the alphabetic sequencing. Rather than tip a hat he picked a name from one.
</p>
<blockquote><p>I picked the first thing that came to mind, which happened to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus">Monty Python&#8217;s Flying Circus</a>, one of my favorite comedy troupes. The reference felt suitably irreverent for what was essentially a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project">&#8220;skunkworks project&#8221;</a>. The word &#8220;Python&#8221; was also catchy, a bit edgy, and at the same time, it fit in the tradition of naming languages after famous people, like Pascal, Ada, and Eiffel.

<h3>Animals</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasguest/3215793436/" title="ya(k|cc) came?l a[uw]k "><img style="float:right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3431/3215793436_6840bb27b3_m.jpg" width="174" height="240" alt="yacc caml awk" /></a>
</p>
<p>Although Guido van Rossum held out for some time against Python being associated with snakes, he eventually <a href="http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/softwear/" title="At last GvR embraces the snake">capitulated</a>. Blame the animal cover lovers at O&#8217;Reilly! As it happens, I rate the reptile as highly as the comedians. I also like languages with animal names. Perhaps <strong>Yacc</strong>, <strong>Awk</strong> and <strong>Caml</strong> also started life as skunkworks?
</p>

<h3>Naming words</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(mythology)"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Virgil_Solis_-_Apollo_Python.jpg/350px-Virgil_Solis_-_Apollo_Python.jpg" alt="Apollo slaying Python"/></a>
</p>
<p>Python is a noun &#8212; what we called a &#8220;naming word&#8221; at junior school. Python is also a proper noun: in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(mythology)" title="Python (mythology)">Greek Mythology</a>, <strong>she</strong> was the earth-dragon of Delphi. It&#8217;s hardly surprising when language creators opt for nouns, often proper, frequently female: <strong>Ada</strong>, <strong>Miranda</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, for example. Also, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Pascal</strong>, <strong>Haskell</strong> &#8212; oh, yes, and <strong>Delphi</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Single characters</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve already mentioned <strong>B</strong>, which I guess is a (homophone of a) girl&#8217;s name. It&#8217;s also a well rounded character found near the front of the alphabet. Alphabetically, B comes before C, and the language B features amongst <strong>C</strong>&#8217;s predecessors. When Bjarne Stroustrup built object-oriented features on top of C, his new language became known as &#8220;new C&#8221; and &#8220;C with classes&#8221;. The former was disrespectful to C, which risked becoming &#8220;old C&#8221;, and the latter failed to excite. The final name, <strong>C++</strong>, was an inspired choice, even if some have pointed out <strong>++C</strong> would be more correct.
</p>
<p><strong>C#</strong> squeezes more juice from the pun. Pronounced &#8220;See Sharp!&#8221;, the name has a commanding ring to it, and if you look within the hash symbol, #, you can make out redoubled ++ signs. Shouldn&#8217;t it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)#Language_name">be written C&#x266f;</a> though, or should we really pronounce it &#8220;See Hash&#8221;? 
</p>
<p>Both the + and the # characters have special semantics within URLs. How many C++ and C# blog posts end up being tagged &#8220;C&#8221;, I wonder? For similar reasons I guess it&#8217;s still impractical to name a language <b>&lambda;</b> or <b>&mu;</b>, unless you&#8217;re prepared to accept that name being spelled <strong>lambda</strong> or <strong>mu</strong>, that is.
</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> really does look like a great language in the C and C++ tradition, but its name lacks imagination. Enough alphabet already!
</p>

<h3>Doing words</h3>
<p><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are both strong, active verbs. Nothing beats being and seeing. Writers like verbs. Verbs make things happen, just like programming languages. Maybe <strong>Lisp</strong> and <strong>Scheme</strong> sound a bit geeky, sleazy even, but I like them. They&#8217;re great names. Ever wonder how <strong>Bash</strong> bludgeoned its way to shell domination? <strong>Squeak</strong> is a great play on <strong>Smalltalk</strong>. Knitters <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/purl"><strong>perl</strong></a>.
</p>

<h3>Etc</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lancearmstrong.com/"><img style="float:right;" src="/images/lance-armstrong.jpg" alt="Lance Armstrong, champion cyclist"/></a>
</p>
<p>Adjectives and adverbs are poorly represented. <strong>Groovy</strong> comes to mind, but not a lot else. Plenty of language names are (or once were) acronyms and abbreviations: as names, I prefer the ones you can read over the mouthfuls of consonants. On this basis, <strong>Fortran</strong> pips <strong>PL/I</strong>, and <strong>Sequel</strong> beats <strong>Ess Queue El</strong>.
</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve listed some great computer languages with great names. Can a good name shape a language&#8217;s success? Well, certainly it can&#8217;t hurt. Names matter. Lance Armstrong is surely the name of a champion, the kind of guy who can beat testicular cancer and win the world&#8217;s toughest endurance event 7 times in a row. Check out his <a href="http://www.lancearmstrong.com/">flash heavy website</a>. Whereas the more gently named Tim Henman never quite fulfilled his tennis potential, and I can&#8217;t even connect to <a href="http://www.timhenman.org">www.timhenman.org</a>.
</p>
<p>Conversely, can a poor name stand in the way of success? <strong>ABC</strong> has become (part of Python&#8217;s) history. I think it&#8217;s fair to say that, at this point, the weakly-named <strong>D</strong> has gained respect rather than presence. On the other hand, <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a poor name too, and <strong>ECMAScript</strong> is worse, but it&#8217;s a fine language which can claim to be more widely deployed than any other.

Choosing a good name for something is very difficult, and I know from past experience that you don&#8217;t usually get a second go.

Yes, that&#8217;s a real example.</p><p>One of my favourite cartoons, The Secret Show, is a comedy spy thriller.  The agency head takes security <i>very</i> seriously, and so his name is changed daily.  He&#8217;s constantly undermined by being assigned ridiculous names - Mimzy Woowoo, Pimlico Buttonfluff, Princess Fairycakes, and so on.  In one episode his new name is Rock Justice, and his chest swells with pride.
