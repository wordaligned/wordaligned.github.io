<p>Evidently Jamie had got in before me. Somehow he&#8217;d unpacked the new 2U server and balanced it on the side of his desk. He looked hassled. I didn&#8217;t ask. The server&#8217;s fans whirred noisily. On Jamie&#8217;s second monitor I could see the familiar chatter of Linux installing itself. I stepped over the cardboard and polystyrene, sat, woke my machine.
</p>
<p>Moments later I heard the install disk eject. Jamie typed something, cursed. The disk clattered into the bin. The room grew quiet as the server shut down.
</p>
<p>We were a small, new team. Nonetheless, we&#8217;d put something substantial together. It built on a Java framework and ran on Linux. We&#8217;d tweaked the framework, meaning we had to build it from source before building our own stuff, so a clean build took almost half an hour. Just over half an hour later, Jamie had burned a new install disk. He placed it in the server&#8217;s DVD drive. The fans roared up again. Ten minutes later, more cursing, another disk in the bin.
</p>
<p>I walked across. Jamie was glaring at some code. A Perl list? His cursor was poised over an item in this list, a single-quoted string, inside which was a sed command, whose arguments themselves needed quoting, which was evidently meant to edit the contents of a double-quoted string in some configuration file. Think: quote and escape. I could see there were <em>four</em> DVDs in the bin. Jamie must have been in for some time. No wonder he looked hassled.
</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s up?
</p>
<p>A trade show in the States. The salesman was out there. A bare machine had already been delivered and he needed the software, so Jamie had to cut a DVD which would directly install the operating system together with our application. Please don&#8217;t expect a salesman to download an ISO image and set up enough of a network to boot from it. A courier was booked for midday to collect the DVD. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s up. So leave me alone and let me get on with it.
</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t actually say that last bit. It&#8217;s true, though, he was the Linux expert. I stubbornly watched as he changed some double quotes for single ones, added a couple more backslashes, checked in the file, kicked off another build.
</p>
<p>Back at my desk, I reviewed the version control change logs. Evidently Jamie was working on a post-install script which took the form of a list of actions which would be evaluated and executed in Perl. Looking at the file diffs, the sticking point seemed to be a sed command to edit the X display settings. Embedding sed within Perl was proving tricky.
</p>
<p>Jamie&#8217;s edit-build-burn-install-check cycle seemed crazy to me. Why not recreate the broken post-install step as a standalone operation? Soon enough I&#8217;d found a way to reproduce the problem. After reading documentation and experimenting I figured out how to nest and escape the various strings. I admit, it took me longer than I expected. By this time Jamie solved the problem by trial and error anyway &#8212; and as proof he had an install disk which he knew worked. He may well have spent less time actually concentrating on the issue than I had; the build-burn-install phases of his process all ran as background activities.
</p>
<p>In the event we needed to revise the software anyway. So the salesman had to download a new build at the last minute. Jamie stayed late the next day to talk him through the installation.
