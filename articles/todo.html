<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<pre>
TODO, TO_DO, TO DO, @todo, 
FIXME, FIX_ME, FIX ME, HACK
</pre>

<p>No other keyword has so many aliases. No other keyword is quite as open to
interpretation.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, our compiler hasn&#8217;t gone soft on us. <code>TODO</code> isn&#8217;t really a
keyword: it lives in comments and can therefore take whatever form a
programmer chooses, safe in the knowledge it won&#8217;t cause trouble at compile or
run time.</p>
<p>On the surface, <code>TODO</code> seems both useful and inevitable. No piece of
code is ever really finished: there will always be something more to
do, and where better to record this information than in the code
itself? If we think more carefully though, we realise that <code>TODO</code>
actually indicates a point at which a decision was made &#8212;a decision
to defer action, a decision, in fact, to <strong>not</strong> do something.  Clearly
this decision is less than ideal. </p>
<p>This article investigates the use of <code>TODO</code> and friends more closely.
First, we shall consider what it is meant to mean and what it often
turns out to mean. Next, we&#8217;ll search through some code, uncover some
use cases, and think about the alternatives. </p>
<p>These alternatives are usually better.  <code>TODO</code>, it turns out, is not
so innocent after all. When used as a shorthand for &#8220;more work
required&#8221; it tells us too little &#8212; and often too late &#8212; and when
used as a convenient label for broken code, it can cause serious
damage to a codebase.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-todo-mean">What Does TODO Mean?</h3>
<p>As stated in the introduction, <code>TODO</code> isn&#8217;t a keyword, it&#8217;s a
comment. Its exact meaning will depend on the local coding culture and
often individual programming style. For example, the Sun 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">Java programming conventions</a> state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>10.5.4 Special Comments</strong> Use XXX in a comment to flag something that is bogus but works. Use FIXME to flag something that is bogus and broken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Already we&#8217;ve found a shocking new member of our <code>TODO</code> set: <code>XXX</code>!</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s clear, though, that the phrase <code>TODO</code> in a comment indicates 
something more is required. With any luck, the rest of the comment will
indicate exactly what that something is.</p>
<p><code>FIXME</code> often seems to be used interchangeably with <code>TODO</code> but carries a
stronger suggestion that something is broken &#8212; if <code>TODO</code> is a feature
request, then <code>FIXME</code> is a defect report. Again, with luck, the rest of the
comment will explain what needs fixing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the rest of the comment is often inadequate. Sometimes we&#8217;ll
find a bare:</p>
<pre><code>// TODO
</code></pre>
<p>sometimes an initialled note-to-self:</p>
<pre><code>// FIXME TAG
</code></pre>
<p>sometimes a plea for attention:</p>
<pre><code>// TODO Fix this hack !!!
</code></pre>
<p>and sometimes even a garbled attempt to cover all bases:</p>
<pre><code>// TODO FIXME XXX HACK
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, <code>TODO</code> isn&#8217;t meant to be pretty.  The capital letters shout at the
reader, drawing attention to the deficiency.  The noise will continue
until something gets done.</p>
<h3 id="ask-the-code">Ask The Code</h3>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being unfair. Let&#8217;s take a look at <code>TODO</code> in action by
searching some source code. On a Unix platform the following command should
output matches in any files beneath the current working directory:</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ grep -ERi "TO[_ ]?DO|FIX[_ ]?ME|HACK|XXX" *

</pre>

</div>

<p>I cannot publish the output of this search on any of the proprietary code I
work on. It&#8217;s confidential information. (The small amount of open source code
I have written or contributed to is <code>TODO</code> free.) Nor am I going to publish
the output of this search on any of the open source code I use &#8212; I do not
think it would be fair, since this article questions the use of <code>TODO</code>. I
should stress, though, that I&#8217;m grateful to have source access, so that any
such comments are at least visible to me.</p>
<p>I would be interested to know how useful the output of your search is. Does
the <code>TODO</code> list correlate with work-in-progress? Are the <code>FIXME</code>s
actively being fixed? Or have we merely generated a list of half-baked ideas,
abandoned experiments and neglected suggestions?</p>
<p>The next section considers some specific use cases which I hope
overlap with our search results.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases-and-alternatives">Use Cases And Alternatives</h3>
<h4 id="place-holders">Place Holders</h4>
<p>In another <a href="http://wordaligned.org/metaprogramming/index.html
article">article</a>, I describe my use of an Emacs <code>elisp</code> program to generate a
skeleton C++ file, which &#8212; amongst other things &#8212; inserts
placeholders for <code>Doxygen</code> comments.</p>
<p>These placeholders had <code>TODO</code>s in them for me to fill in. Or at least they
used to! I have now decided I would rather leave a class undocumented than 
have it ever look like this:</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * TODO write a description of MyNewClass.
 */
class MyNewClass {
    ....
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>TODO</code> in the example above serves no useful purpose &#8212; I&#8217;m well aware the
new class needs describing, <code>Doxygen</code> will warn me should I forget &#8212; and as
a consequence my <code>elisp</code> now generates smaller but better-formed skeleton
files. This reflects more accurately the way I aspire to work: no
broken code.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject, note that editor macros make it all too easy to
create unfinished or extravagent comments. A block of asterisks is a poor way
to fill a source file:</p>
<pre>
/* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 *                                                     *
 *           M Y   N E W    C L A S S                  *
 *                                                     *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */
</pre>

<h4 id="generated-code">Generated Code</h4>
<p>My <code>elisp</code> metaprogram is of course a code-generator. When I realised it was
producing broken output I stepped in and fixed it. With third-party code
generators we may not be so lucky.</p>
<p>Consider a GUI builder which allows us to design our user interface and map
buttons events to actions. The output of this builder is some auto-generated
code with placeholders:</p>
<pre><code>void MyDialog::OnButtonClick(Button button) {
    // TODO. Insert button action code here.
}
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly there&#8217;s a potential problem if the auto-generation is repeated. Will
any callbacks we implement be replaced with <code>TODO</code>&#8217;s?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much we can do about this &#8212; unless we are GUI builder writers, in
which case we might consider better ways to separate the generated code from
the application-specific implementation.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why many seasoned GUI developers drop the framework early on,
preferring the control they get from hand-crafted code?</p>
<h4 id="work-in-progress">Work-in-progress</h4>
<p>Suppose a programmer creates a new class, <code>NewClass</code>, whose interface offers
clients, amongst other things, a pair of serialization functions:</p>
<pre><code>NewClass {
    ....
public: // Serialization 
    void put(std::ostream &amp; put_to) const;
    void get(std::istream &amp; get_from);
    ....
};
</code></pre>
<p>The output function is quickly coded up. The input function turns out to be
rather trickier. Now, the programmer sensibly wishes to put work-in-progress
into the source management system as soon as possible, and hence checks in an
empty implementation:</p>
<pre><code>void NewClass::get(std::istream &amp; get_from) {
    // TODO
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we understand the <code>TODO</code> to mean that, although the code compiles, the
implementation is incomplete. Client code shouldn&#8217;t try to <code>get</code> instances of
this new class just yet.</p>
<p>The trouble is, as far as client code is concerned &#8212; at both compile and run
time &#8212; the comment has no effect. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine a scenario where
we accidentally end up reading in a <code>NewClass</code>, leading to some unwanted
effect downstream, possibly in an apparently unrelated piece of code.</p>
<p>Any time spent tracking down such a problem has been wasted. The moment the
<code>TODO</code> was written, we were aware of its exact location and cause.</p>
<p>A better technique is to call a function:</p>
<pre><code>void NewClass::get(std::istream &amp; from) const {
    NotYetImplemented();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>NotYetImplemented()</code> might fire an assertion, raise an exception, or
log an error message. At the very simplest, we could put a rough
and ready macro into service:</p>
<pre><code>#define NotYetImplemented() assert(!"Not yet implemented!")
</code></pre>
<p>As usual, the move from comment to code improves things. Now the system offers
more useful diagnostics in the event of an unimplemented function being
called: but it won&#8217;t save us from trouble if this event happens once the
software has been shipped. We are still reliant on someone
remembering to finish what got started. Here, test-driven development
techniques are invaluable. They are so important they merit fuller discussion
later in this article.</p>
<h4 id="notes-to-self">Notes to Self</h4>
<p>Consider the following struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct FileSize { // TODO 64 bit
    unsigned long ms_4_bytes;
    unsigned long ls_4_bytes;  
};
</code></pre>
<p>I classify this <code>TODO</code> as a note-to-self since it may not be obvious to anyone
but the programmer who wrote the comment exactly what should be done to
the code on a 64 bit platform. If we <code>grep</code> around surrounding source
files, we&#8217;ll probably find a few similar comments and get a better idea of
what&#8217;s required.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s even more clear that we&#8217;re dealing with a note-to-self.</p>
<pre><code>struct FileSize { // TODO 64 bit. TAG
    ....
};
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the author uses his initials to stake a claim on the <code>struct</code>. He
seems to be saying, &#8220;I know what needs doing, and I&#8217;ll probably be the one who
does it&#8221;. Ideally, of course, when we undertake a 64 bit port, he will still
be around to tie up these loose ends; even if he isn&#8217;t, he has left us some
useful pointers.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a bad use of <code>TODO</code>. It&#8217;s certainly preferable to the programmer
keeping the <code>TODO</code> list in his head, or even in his log book. The information is
where it needs to be, often down to individual lines of code. My only quibble
is with the note-to-self attitude. When we check in code, we release it
to a wider audience; we are publishing our work. These notes-to-self should
really be notes-to-everyone.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, then, there will be a little more documentation explaining
the porting task in more detail. Pair-programming, peer review and open source
development can help us maintain a disciplined approach.</p>
<h3 id="latent-defects">Latent Defects</h3>
<p>Suppose we&#8217;re digging around some legacy code<a id="fn1link"
href="#fn1"><sup><a href="/articles/my-test-first-ruby-program.html">1</a></sup></a> and we discover the following bizarre integer
literal in an assignment:</p>
<pre><code>flags &amp;= 0xFFFFFFF7;
</code></pre>
<p>What to do? Evidently bit three of the <code>unsigned int flags</code> variable is
being cleared, but so are bits thirty-two and above. Is this the intended
behaviour?</p>
<p>Now, the code in question is regarded as sound. It works. Target
platforms have always had thirty-two bit <code>int</code>s, and will continue to do so for
the forseeable future.</p>
<p>We could make a note in the code and move on:</p>
<pre><code>flags &amp;= 0xFFFFFFF7; // FIXME this assumes 32 bit ints
</code></pre>
<p>If we&#8217;re feeling less confident, the note might read:</p>
<pre><code>flags &amp;= 0xFFFFFFF7; // TODO doesn't this assume 32 bit ints !?
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if we&#8217;re feeling more confident, we make the fix directly:</p>
<pre><code>flags &amp;= ~(1U &lt;&lt; 3);
</code></pre>
<p>Personally, I dislike adding comments as shown above. Yes, it&#8217;s better than
ignoring the problem, but only marginally. By adding a comment we&#8217;re ducking the
issue. On the other hand it&#8217;s also risky to modify legacy code even when we
think we&#8217;re fixing it. Who knows what compensating code there might be elsewhere
in the system?</p>
<p>A more responsible reaction is to dig a little deeper and find exactly how
pervasive the problem is. The assumption that <code>int</code>s occupy thirty-two bits
may cut across many lines in many files &#8212; and yet, as stated earlier, this
assumption may actually be reasonable, at least for the forseeable future. Not
all code needs to be portable.</p>
<p>Even if we are prepared to continue with this assumption about target
platforms, the important thing is not to throw away our insight. With barely
any extra effort we can replace the <code>TODO</code> with a <a href="http://boost.org/doc/html/boost_staticassert.html">compile-time assertion</a>.</p>
<pre><code>BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT == 32);
</code></pre>
<p>With this assertion in place, the code won&#8217;t even compile if we try and port to
a platform which doesn&#8217;t meet this assumption.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if digging deeper reveals more latent defects, and if
we already have reason to believe the <a href="#fn1">legacy code</a> is in poor shape, then more
radical action may be needed.</p>
<h4 id="grand-designs">Grand Designs</h4>
<p>At the other end of the scale are the <code>TODO</code>s which claim a glorious
future for a sound &#8212; if straightforward &#8212; block of code.</p>
<pre><code>// TODO use an adaptive search algorithm:
// 1) keep a log of past commands
// 2) when the system is idle, review this log to predict the next command
// 3) pre-fetch the results of the predicted command.
// This should make the UI more responsive.
</code></pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope this ingenious scheme isn&#8217;t attempted until careful analysis shows
that it really is necessary and calibrated test runs prove that it really can
improve response times.</p>
<p>Until then, this particular <code>TODO</code> is simply an incitement to over-engineering.</p>
<h3 id="future-optimisations">Future Optimisations</h3>
<p>Closely related to Grand Designs are those points in a code-base where a
progammer uses <code>TODO</code> to indicate where a sub-optimal solution has been used.
Maybe a hand-crafted container might offer client code quicker lookups
than the one which was picked, for convenience, from the C++ Standard
Library.</p>
<pre><code>typedef std::map&lt;person, phone_number&gt; phone_book; 
// TODO replace with a hash map for efficiency
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>TODO</code> looks reasonable enough, but again I think it may lead us astray.
Why should we consider making this replacement? Why should the suggestion be
repeated every time we look at this code?</p>
<p>If we do find our code runs too slowly we need to measure first. The
hand-rolled hash map might make no perceptible difference; but simplifying the
arithmetic in that innocent looking loop the profiler warned us about might
realise a 50% speed-up with far less effort.</p>
<h3 id="the-hideous-hack">The Hideous Hack</h3>
<p>Consider the following scenario. Testing reveals that a peculiar &#8212;
but reproducible &#8212; combination of events can lead to deadlock. A
SHOWSTOPPER defect is raised and assigned to some unfortunate
programmer. The programmer must delay her current task to
investigate. After a couple of frustrating days of poring over log
files she narrows the problem down. It looks very like a race
condition in a particular function.</p>
<p>To test her suspicions, she injects a ten millisecond delay into one of the
calling threads. The defect goes away!</p>
<p>Armed with this evidence, she consults the programmers involved. The original
author of the function has nothing helpful to say &#8212; clearly it&#8217;s the client
code (which does the synchronisation) which is at fault. Equally unhelpfully,
the authors of the client code suggest the proper solution is to move
responsibility for synchronisation into the function itself.</p>
<p>All this blame-storming is holding up development. The project manager
makes the call: check in the ten millisecond delay, change the defect
to LOW priority, get on with new features.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it will come as a surprise to find out that the code still reads
as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Sleep(10); // HACK. Workaround a race condition.
           // See DEFECT 5678 for details.
</code></pre>
<p>Nor should it surprise us to learn that the defect hasn&#8217;t really gone away,
it has just gone under cover. The software still deadlocks. Less often, less
reproducibly, but just as disastrously.</p>
<p>This article is about the use of <code>TODO</code>, not dysfunctional development teams.
A proper solution will involve the organisation as much as the code-base, and
will have to remain beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Clearly, though, something very wrong has happened. I&#8217;m not claiming that
<code>TODO</code> &#8212;or, in this case, its unsavoury relative, <code>HACK</code> &#8212;is to blame.
What I do suggest is that this use of <code>HACK</code> opens the door 
(breaks the window perhaps?<a id="fn2link" href="#fn2"><sup><a href="/articles/readable-code.html" title="Readable code">2</a></sup></a>) 
to similar abuse in future. When we introduce such
code into our system we sanction the approach it takes, inviting more of the
same.</p>
<p>Sure enough, as features continue to be added, we find more and more
Sleep()s, HACKs and TODOs attempting to disguise a broken threading
model.</p>
<h3 id="test-frameworks">Test Frameworks</h3>
<p>Remember the programmer who checked a stubbed function into the
source management system?</p>
<pre><code>void NewClass::get(std::istream &amp; get_from) {
    // TODO
}
</code></pre>
<p>In a test-first environment, the <code>TODO</code> is superfluous. The accompanying unit
tests show exactly what needs doing. In a console window, we see
something like:</p>
<pre><code>Test    : testNewClassGet
testNewClass.cpp(57): Expected "foo" but got "bar"
Ran 13 tests, 12 Passed, 1 Failed.
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the feedback is swift and accurate, and continues to be so even once
the class is complete (that is to say, once it passes its tests). Should
something cause <code>NewClass</code> to regress, a good set of tests will isolate the
error even before the offending code gets checked in.</p>
<p>In other words, the <code>TODO</code> list and the <code>FIXME</code> list have been replaced by
test results. We have done the best we can to ensure our <code>NewClass</code> does
not end up being yet another <code>LegacyClass</code>.</p>
<p>Now remember the <code>HACK</code> which covered up a broken threading model. We will need
to work much harder to stop the rot advancing any further (in both the
code-base and the organisation), but again, my main recommendation would be to
invest in a test framework &#8212; a system test framework in this case.</p>
<p>If we can create a suite of tests which exercise the code to systematically
expose the threading problems, we may have a chance of understanding them. If
we can automate these tests and publish results in a user-friendly form &#8212;
bearing in mind that users are not just engineers, but everyone with an
interest in the code-base &#8212; then we may yet fix them.</p>
<h3 id="the-case-against-todo">The Case Against TODO</h3>
<p>This article has covered the use and abuse of <code>TODO</code>. In some cases, it is
redundant; in others inadequate; in others misleading; and in yet others it
could more usefully be replaced by code. <code>TODO</code> is sometimes a note written in
some personal shorthand, which, like many such notes, is in danger of becoming
meaningless to even its originator.</p>
<p>I have no major problem with any of these uses, though personally I avoid
them. It&#8217;s the times when <code>TODO</code> (or <code>FIXME</code> or <code>HACK</code>) gets roped in to defer
the proper treatment of a defect which make it suspect.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/journals/284">Overload 68</a>, Alan Griffiths writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The worst thing that can be done on encountering a problem is to
ignore it on the basis that &#8220;someone else&#8221; should deal with it. The
next worst thing is to bury it in a write-only &#8220;issues list&#8221; in the
hope that one day someone will deal with it. If everyone behaves like
that then nobody deals with anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Griffiths is talking about problems in a wider sense, perhaps, than this
article, but he expresses my frustration with <code>TODO</code> perfectly. A search
through code for <code>TODO</code>s is all too likely to reveal a &#8220;write only issues
list&#8221;. Too often, <code>FIXME</code> silently marks a place where we know something is
wrong, but we haven&#8217;t bothered to do anything about it. Worst of all, <code>HACK</code>
gets deployed when we know something is wrong and we fear we might have
made it worse.</p>
<hr />
<p><a id="fn1" href="#fn1link"><a href="/articles/my-test-first-ruby-program.html">1</a> Legacy Code</a> I haven&#8217;t defined what I mean by
legacy code here &#8212; but the risk associated with change is surely a defining
characteristic. In his book &#8220;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&#8221;, Michael
Feathers chooses a specific and objective definition: legacy code is code which
has no unit tests. He goes on to offer some sound advice on how to work with
such code: that is, how to put it under test. Once the tests are in place, the
risks associated with change reduce.</p>
<p><a id="fn2" href="#fn2link"><a href="/articles/readable-code.html" title="Readable code">2</a> Broken Windows.</a> In &#8220;The Pragmatic
Programmer: From Journeyman to Master&#8221; Andrew Hunt and Dave Thomas advise us not
to live with broken windows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time,
instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment &#8212;a
sense that the powers that be don&#8217;t care about the building. So another
window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious
structural damage begins. In a relatively short space of time, the
building becomes damaged beyond the owner&#8217;s desire to fix it, and the
sense of abandonment becomes reality.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hunt and Thomas suggest the same is true of software: when we
discover something is broken, we must repair it promptly. Deferring the
repair work with a <code>TODO</code> or a <code>FIXME</code> risks making things worse. The next
programmer to visit the code is unlikely to make the fix, but may well
be encouraged to adopt <code>TODO</code> to defer the treatment of similar problems
elsewhere.</p>
