<h2 id="timtowtdi">TIMTOWTDI</h2>
<p>TIMTOWTDI stands for &#8220;There is more than one way to do it&#8221;, an approach promoted by the Perl community.</p>
<p>The mindset behind it gets explored in more detail by the language&#8217;s creator, Larry Wall, in a talk given in 1999: <a href="https://www.perl.com/pub/1999/03/pm.html/">&#8220;Perl, the first postmodern computer language&#8221;</a>. He attributes the slogan to his daughter, Heidi, who says it&#8217;s a strategy which works well in her maths class; and <strong>she</strong> associates it with another saying used at school: &#8220;Tsall Good&#8221;. This doesn&#8217;t mean everything is good, or even everything has good bits. It means, overall, things are good. See the big picture.</p>
<p>Perl epitomises this. It&#8217;s eclectic and inclusive, supporting a variety of styles. One-liner? Fine! Like a shell script? Sure! Structured programming, object-oriented, functional? Why not! Tsall good.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>But do I feel that way about programming?</p>
<h2 id="tsbo-apoo-owtdi">TSBO-APOO-OWTDI</h2>
<p>A contrasting mantra appears in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a>, a list of aphorisms which summarise the guiding principles behind Python&#8217;s design. Item number 13 states &#8220;There should be one &#8212; and preferably only one &#8212; obvious way to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps realising this sounds overly prescriptive, this rule is tempered by item 14, &#8220;Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&#8217;re Dutch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guido van Rossum, Python&#8217;s BDFL &#8212; Benevolent Dictator For Life &#8212; would be the Dutch person who finds things obvious. That&#8217;s right: <strong>Dictator</strong>. Programmers don&#8217;t like being told what to do any more than two year olds. How then has Python become so popular? </p>
<p>Maybe emphasis falls on <strong>should</strong>. There <strong>should</strong> be only one obvious way to do it: it&#8217;s just that &#8212; Dutch or otherwise &#8212; we haven&#8217;t got there yet.</p>
<h2 id="timtop">TIMTOP</h2>
<p>For example, there is more than one Python. Obviously there&#8217;s Python 2 and Python 3, but it&#8217;s less obvious which to use. Don&#8217;t forget <a href="https://pypy.org/">PyPy</a>. Increasingly Python comes packaged with data processing and visualisation extensions, served up as a <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebook.</p>
<h2 id="timtopom">TIMTOPOM</h2>
<p>There is more than one program options module.</p>
<p>When I started with Python there was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/getopt.html">getopt</a>, the one and only command line handler. Coming from a C/C++ background I was quite happy to use something resembling GNU&#8217;s getopt. Then <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html">optparse</a> appeared. Now there&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">argparse</a>. All of these libraries are readily available. Which should I use? Not optparse, that&#8217;s deprecated, unless I&#8217;m already using it and it works, that is. Regarding the other contenders, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/getopt.html">documentation</a> archly notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users who are unfamiliar with the C <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getopt.3.html"><code>getopt()</code></a> function or who would like to write less code and get better help and error messages should consider using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse">argparse module</a> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are other non-standard Python options for parsing a command line too: ones which <a href="http://docopt.org/">generate code from the usage</a> notes, or by <a href="https://github.com/google/python-fire">inspecting the code you want to expose</a>.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to do it.</p>
<h2 id="timtoutf">TIMTOUTF</h2>
<p>There is more than one unit test framework. The obvious one, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>, like getopt, draws inspiration from elsewhere &#8212; in this case Java&#8217;s Junit. Unfortunately the port is too faithful, and you&#8217;ll have to inherit from super classes etc to test something. I much prefer <a href="https://docs.pytest.org">PyTest</a>, which flexes the language itself to deliver test assertions as <code>assert</code>s.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html">doctest</a> module in the standard library which executes and checks code found in strings (hold that thought!), and there are many other non-standard testing frameworks.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to do it.</p>
<h2 id="timtowofs">TIMTOWOFS</h2>
<p>There is more than one way of formatting strings.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen there&#8217;s more than one Python, and libraries are always up for reinvention. This is arguably evolution rather than a multiplicity of options. That is, the most recent way to do it should be preferred.</p>
<p>When it comes to string formatting, though, there has <strong>always</strong> been more than one way to do it, and more ways are still being added.</p>
<p>Do you use <code>'single'</code> or <code>"double"</code> quotes for a string? <code>"""Triple"""</code> quotes. Raw strings? Raw with an <code>r</code> or Raw with an <code>R</code>? TIMTOWTDI.</p>
<p>What if you want to embed the value of a variable in a string? Users familiar with C&#8217;s <code>printf()</code> function might prefer <code>%</code> formatting. Fans of $shell $parameter $expansion can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings">template strings</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/">Advanced string formatting</a> &#8212; <code>str.format</code> &#8212; appeared in Python 3.0, backported to Python 2.6. No doubt it has advantages over <code>%</code> formatting, but for me it&#8217;s a little more obscure and a little less obvious. Python 3.6 introduces <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/">f-strings</a> which build on <code>str.format</code> and knock down my reservations. The syntax allows you to evaluate expressions in strings: evidently Python is heading in Perl&#8217;s direction.</p>
<h2 id="apsdotadiw">APSDOTADIW</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s finish by returning to Perl, and to <a href="https://www.perl.com/pub/1999/03/pm.html/">Larry Wall&#8217;s 1999 talk</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many times have we heard the mantra that a program should do one thing and do it well?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perl is not that program. Perl wants to do everything well. It integrates features and makes no attempt to homogenise them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ve all heard the saying: If all you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perl is no hammer: it has memorably been described as a Swiss army chainsaw, but Larry Wall likens it to a more conventional tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If all you have is duct tape, everything starts to look like a duct. Right. When&#8217;s the last time you used duct tape on a duct?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Python may aspire to offer a single obvious way to do something. It fails splendidly, being more duct tape than hammer.</p>

<p>I presented this blog post as a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyDiff/events/249220768">lightning talk at PyDiff</a> a couple of days ago. The <a href="/docs/timtowtdi">slides are here</a>. The talk was recorded too: <a href="https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=324c4015-51ed-4bd7-a1c7-a8c50089e746">I appear about 24 minutes in</a>.</p>
