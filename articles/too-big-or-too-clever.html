<p>When it comes to programming languages, not everyone equates <em>dynamic</em> with <em>better</em>, but I was surprised to read Alex Martelli cautioning against it. Here he is though, in a recent <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/28422d707512283">post</a> on <code>comp.lang.python</code>, responding eloquently to the topic &#8220;What&#8217;s better about Ruby than Python?&#8221;. </p>
<p><span id="continue-reading"/></p>
<h3 id="too-clever">Too clever</h3>
<p>Martelli identifies a fundamental difference between the two languages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; Ruby&#8217;s TOTAL, unbridled &#8220;dynamicity&#8221;, including the ability to &#8220;reopen&#8221; any existing class, including all built-in ones, and change its behavior at run-time &#8212; vs Python&#8217;s vast but <em>bounded</em> dynamicity, which never changes the behavior of existing built-in classes and their instances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He considers this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; a crucial issue &#8212; one that makes Ruby much more suitable for &#8220;tinkering&#8221;, BUT Python equally more suitable for use in large production applications.  It&#8217;s funny, in a way, because both languages are so MUCH more dynamic than most others, that in the end the key difference between them from my POV should hinge on that &#8212; that Ruby &#8220;goes to eleven&#8221; in this regard (the reference here is to &#8220;Spinal Tap&#8221;, of course).  In Ruby, there are no limits to my creativity &#8212; if I decide that all string comparisons must become case-insensitive, I CAN DO THAT!  I.e., I can dynamically alter the built-in string class so that</p>
<pre>
    a = "Hello World"
    b = "hello world"
    if a == b
        print "equal!\n"
    else
        print "different!\n"
    end
</pre>
<p>WILL print &#8220;equal&#8221;.</p>
<p>In python, there is NO way I can do
that.  For the purposes of metaprogramming, implementing
experimental frameworks, and the like, this amazing dynamic
ability of Ruby is _extremely_ appealing.  BUT &#8212; if we&#8217;re
talking about large applications, developed by many people
and maintained by even more, including all kinds of libraries
from diverse sources, and needing to go into production in
client sites&#8230; well, I don&#8217;t WANT a language that is QUITE
so dynamic, thank you very much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard this opinion before, nudged even further along the static-dynamic scale. Some argue Python is <a href="/articles/pitching-python-in-three-syllables.html">too dynamic</a> for large applications; that you&#8217;re better off with something more disciplined, statically typed, enterprise ready, something with decent IDEs to keep your code in shape &#8212; something like Java.</p>
<h3 id="too-big">Too Big</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html">&#8220;Code&#8217;s Worst Enemy&#8221;</a> Steve Yegge rants about his own large application:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; a beautiful game [written] in an ugly language &#8230; lovely on the outside and quite horrific internally</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ugly language turns out to be Java, 500,000 lines of it. Eclipse won&#8217;t load it. The code base has collapsed under its own weight.</p>
<p>Yegge identifies size as the enemy. More controversially, he argues some of our conventional allies in countering this enemy are, in fact, traitors. Refactoring, for one: applied to Java, it can result in code bloat. And all that design-pattern boiler-plate. Look, even our precious IDEs deceive us!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Java-style IDEs intrinsically create a circular problem. The circularity stems from the nature of programming languages: the &#8220;game piece&#8221; shapes are determined by the language&#8217;s static type system. Java&#8217;s game pieces don&#8217;t permit code elimination because Java&#8217;s static type system doesn&#8217;t have any compression facilities &#8212; no macros, no lambdas, no declarative data structures, no templates, nothing that would permit the removal of the copy-and-paste duplication patterns that Java programmers think of as &#8220;inevitable boilerplate&#8221;, but which are in fact easily factored out in dynamic languages.</p>
<p>Completing the circle, dynamic features make it more difficult for IDEs to work their static code-base-management magic. IDEs don&#8217;t work as well with dynamic code features, so IDEs are responsible for encouraging the use of languages that require&#8230; IDEs. Ouch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Yegge gets a lot wrong in this rant, but it&#8217;s clear he speaks from experience, and for all his swagger it&#8217;s also clear he&#8217;s thought hard about what he says. I agree with his main point: <strong>size is the enemy</strong>. And I agree with his conclusion too. You need a language which allows you to dispense with boiler-plate, a language in which you <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself">don&#8217;t have to repeat yourself</a>. A powerful language. A dynamic language.</p>
<h3 id="whos-right">Who&#8217;s Right?</h3>
<p>So, who&#8217;s right? </p>
<p>For a large application developed by a large team and maintained by a larger one could a language like Ruby be <strong>too dynamic</strong>? </p>
<p>Or is <strong>size the enemy</strong>? Do we need a language so powerful it <a href="http://blog.plover.com/prog/design-patterns.html">absorbs design patterns</a>, so dynamic we never need repeat ourselves, so succinct we can <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/head.html">fit the code in our heads</a>?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the latter. A dynamic language might be too slow (for a few parts of a system) but it can&#8217;t be too dynamic. Meta-programming requires taste and restraint, of course, not to mention boundaries; and we mustn&#8217;t expect any one programming language to fix our design. For any large system, I&#8217;d expect multiple components, layers of abstraction &#8212; and layers of languages.</p>
