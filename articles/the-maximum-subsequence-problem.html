<p>The Pearly Gates club never closes. Its public entrance, a revolving door, just keeps on spinning. With each rotation some punters enter and others leave. The club&#8217;s owners would like to track this traffic. Specifically, they&#8217;d like to know the maximum increase in people entering the club over a given period.
</p>
<p>The starting point is to track the people who enter/leave with each spin of the door. Here&#8217;s a 5 minute sample of that information. Negative numbers mean more people left than entered during a particular cycle.

<p>The archetypal problem we&#8217;d like to solve can be stated:
</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Given a sequence of numbers, find the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of those numbers.</strong> 
</p>
</blockquote><p>As an example, the maximum sum contiguous subsequence of 0, -1, <strong>2, -1, 3</strong>, -1, 0 would be 4 (= 2 + -1 + 3).
</p>
<p>This problem is generally known as <strong>the maximum sum contiguous subsequence problem</strong> and if you haven&#8217;t encountered it before, I&#8217;d recommend trying to solve it before reading on. Even if you have encountered it before, I&#8217;ll invite you to read on anyway &#8212; it&#8217;s well worth another look.

<h3><a href="#toc1" name="tocprogramming-pearl" id="tocprogramming-pearl">Programming Pearl</a></h3>
<p>The maximum sum contiguous subsequence problem appears in Jon Bentley&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/pearls/">&#8220;Programming Pearls&#8221;</a>. He first presents a brute force solution which examines all possible contiguous subsequences of the initial sequence and returns the maximum sum of these subsequences.
</p>
<p>A Python implementation might read:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">def generate_pairs(n):
    "Generate all pairs (i, j) such that 0 &lt;= i &lt;= j &lt; n"
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            yield i, j

def max_sum_subsequence(seq):
    "Return the max-sum contiguous subsequence of the input sequence."
    return max(sum(seq[i:j])
               for i, j in generate_pairs(len(seq) + 1))

</pre>

</div>

<p>It&#8217;s a straightforward piece of code, though note the <code>+ 1</code> which ensures that we slice to the end of <code>seq</code>, and also that we include empty slices, which sum to <code>0</code>, handling the case when every item in the sequence is negative. The trouble is, the algorithm is of cubic complexity: to process just 6 hours of logged activity takes over 2 minutes on a 2GHz Intel Core Duo MacBook, and the cubic nature of the algorithm means we&#8217;d quickly fail to process more substantial log files in real time.

<p>A simple optimisation eliminates the repeated calls to <code>sum</code> by accumulating the input sequence &#8212; the red line in the graph above. Subtracting element <code>i-1</code> from element <code>j</code> of this cumulative sequence gives us the sum of elements in the range i, j of the original sequence. We won&#8217;t study the code for this quadratic solution &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t add much to our analysis. Again, some care is needed to avoid <a href="/articles/joined-output-and-the-fencepost-problem.html">fencepost problems</a>.
</p>
<p>We won&#8217;t look at the divide-and-conquer NlogN solution either. It&#8217;s hard to understand, and we can do far better.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc2" name="toclinear-solution" id="toclinear-solution">Linear Solution</a></h3>
<p>There is a linear solution. The idea is to scan the sequence from start to finish keeping track of <code>maxsofar</code>, the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence seen so far, and <code>maxendinghere</code>, the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence which ends at the current position. Bentley&#8217;s pseudo-code reads:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">maxsofar = 0
maxendinghere = 0
for i = [0, n)
    /* invariant: maxendinghere and maxsofar are accurate
       are accurate for x[0..i-1] */
    maxendinghere = max(maxendinghere + x[i], 0)
    maxsofar = max(maxsofar, maxendinghere)

</pre>

</div>

<p>This translates directly into Python.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">def max_sum_subsequence(seq):
    maxsofar = 0
    maxendinghere = 0
    for s in seq:
        # invariant: maxendinghere and maxsofar are accurate
        # are accurate up to s
        maxendinghere = max(maxendinghere + s, 0)
        maxsofar = max(maxsofar, maxendinghere)
    return maxsofar

</pre>

</div>

<p>Now, this is a fabulous solution. Bentley describes it as subtle. Such a succinct code snippet hardly <strong>looks</strong> subtle, but I agree, the loop body <strong>does</strong> take a bit of understanding:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">maxendinghere = max(maxendinghere + s, 0)
maxsofar = max(maxsofar, maxendinghere)

</pre>

</div>

<p><strong>Why does this work?</strong> 
</p>
<p>Well, essentially maxendinghere is what&#8217;s accumulating the subsequences &#8212; it keeps rolling the next element into itself. Should this accumulated sum ever become negative we know that the subsequence-which-ends-here we&#8217;re currently tracking is worse than the empty subsequence-which-restarts-here; so we can reset our subsequence accumulator, and the first clause of the loop invariant still holds. Combine this with the observation that maxsofar tracks peaks in maxendinghere and we&#8217;re done.
</p>
<p>The loop-invariant comment provides a good example of how comments can help us understand an algorithm, even though the code is minimal and the variable names are well-chosen.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc3" name="tocstreaming-solution" id="tocstreaming-solution">Streaming Solution</a></h3>
<p>I prefer to think of this problem in terms of streams &#8212; lazily evaluated sequences. Think of our log file as generating a stream of numbers:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">... 0 1 2 -3 3 -1 0 -4 0 -1 -4 2 4 1 1 3 1 0 -2 -3 -3 -2 3 1 1 4 5 -3 -2 -1 ...

</pre>

</div>

<p>The first thing we do is transform this stream to generate another stream, the cumulative sum of numbers seen so far. It&#8217;s an integration of sorts. You&#8217;ll remember we already used this stream, or an in-memory version of it, in our quadratic solution to the problem: the difference between points on it yields subsequence-sums.
</p>

<h4><a href="#toc4" name="tocstream-accumulate" id="tocstream-accumulate">Stream Accumulate</a></h4>
<p>We generate the accumulated stream from our original stream like this:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">def stream_accumulate(stream):
    total = 0
    for s in stream:
        total += s
        yield total

</pre>

</div>

<p>The graph below samples the first five minutes of this stream. The red line accumulates values from the pale grey line.
</p>

&amp;chd=t:44.4,50.0,55.6,27.8,61.1,38.9,44.4,22.2,44.4,38.9,22.2,55.6,66.7,50.0,50.0,61.1,50.0,44.4,33.3,27.8,27.8,33.3,61.1,50.0,50.0,66.7,72.2,27.8,33.3,38.9|44.4,50.0,61.1,44.4,61.1,55.6,55.6,33.3,33.3,27.8,5.6,16.7,38.9,44.4,50.0,66.7,72.2,72.2,61.1,44.4,27.8,16.7,33.3,38.9,44.4,66.7,94.4,77.8,66.7,61.1

&amp;chco=CCCCCC,CC0000
&amp;chls=3,1,0|3,1,0
&amp;chdl=Entries|Accum.+Entries
" />

<p>These accumulated numbers represent the number of members who have entered the club since we started tracking them. On our graph, the maximum sum contiguous subsequence is simply the greatest Y-increase between any two points on this graph. X&#8217;s mark these points on the graph above. (Note: it&#8217;s <strong>not</strong> the Y-range of the graph we want since our X-values are time-ordered, and we require X1 &lt;= X2). 
</p>

<h4><a href="#toc5" name="tocstream-floor" id="tocstream-floor">Stream Floor</a></h4>
<p>A second transformation yields the floor of the accumulated stream.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">import sys

def stream_floor(stream):
    m = 0
    for s in stream:
        m = min(m, s)
        yield m

</pre>

</div>

<p>(Note that, for our purposes, the floor of the stream isn&#8217;t exactly the stream of minimum values taken by the stream &#8212; we enforce a baseline at zero. It would be better to allow clients of this function to supply an optional baseline value, but I wanted the simplest possible code that shows the idea.)
</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a graph plotting the accumulated entries alongside the floor of these entries.
</p>

&amp;chd=t:44.4,50.0,61.1,44.4,61.1,55.6,55.6,33.3,33.3,27.8,5.6,16.7,38.9,44.4,50.0,66.7,72.2,72.2,61.1,44.4,27.8,16.7,33.3,38.9,44.4,66.7,94.4,77.8,66.7,61.1|44.4,44.4,44.4,44.4,44.4,44.4,44.4,33.3,33.3,27.8,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6,5.6

&amp;chls=3,1,0|3,1,0
&amp;chm=b,CCCCCC,0,1,0
&amp;chdl=Accum.+Entries|Floor+Accum.+Entries
" />

<p>We&#8217;re very close to what we want now. We can track Y-increases on the graph just by generating the difference between the accumulated stream and its floor &#8212; the shading on the graph.
</p>

<h4><a href="#toc6" name="tocstream-diff" id="tocstream-diff">Stream Diff</a></h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s an implementation of <code>stream_diff</code>. We can&#8217;t just plug a minus sign &#8220;-&#8221; into the mapping function, so we have to use the less wieldy <code>operator.sub</code>.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">import itertools
import operator

def stream_diff(s, t):
    return itertools.imap(operator.sub, s, t)

</pre>

</div>

<p>Alternatively, we could generate the new stream with an explicit loop:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">import itertools

def stream_diff(s, t):
    for ss, tt in itertools.izip(s, t):
        yield ss - tt

</pre>

</div>

<p>The final graph shows us the difference between the accumulated entry count and its floor. I&#8217;ve also added the ceiling of this stream as a thick red line (I&#8217;m sure you can figure out how to implement <code>stream_ceiling</code>), and this ceiling represents the stream of maximum sum contiguous subsequences.

<p>We&#8217;ve re-labelled the lines <code>Max-so-far</code> and <code>Max-ending-here</code> because they&#8217;re the stream of values taken by the variables <code>maxsofar</code> and <code>maxendinghere</code> during Bentley&#8217;s clever solution to the maximum sum contiguous subsequence problem. I think we&#8217;re in a better position to understand how this solution works now.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc7" name="tocstreams-and-collections" id="tocstreams-and-collections">Streams and Collections</a></h3>
<p>Please don&#8217;t imagine these streams are bloated. <span id="excerpt0"/>They may be infinite (remember the Pearly Gates club never closes!) but that doesn&#8217;t mean they take up much space. The graphs shown represent snapshots of their activity, and at no point do our presented algorithms actually store a five minute buffer of entries.
</p>
<p>A final solution to the maximum sum contiguous subsequence problem reads like this. We&#8217;ve pushed the general purpose stream transformation functions into a separate module, <code>stream.py</code>.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">import itertools
import stream

def max_sum_subsequence_stream(ss):
    "Return the stream of max sum contiguous subsequences of the input iterable."
    accu1, accu2 = itertools.tee(stream.accumulate(ss))
    return stream.ceil(stream.diff(accu1, 
                       stream.floor(accu2, baseline=0)))

def max_sum_subsequence(ss):
    "Return the max sum of a contiguous subsequence of the input iterable."
    return stream.last(max_sum_subsequence_stream(ss))

</pre>

</div>

<p>The iterable supplied to <code>max_sum_subsequence</code> has its last value read, and should therefore be bounded if we want the function to return. We haven&#8217;t supplied arguments to extract a portion of this iterable (to generate maximum subsequences for the club on a particular day, for example) because that&#8217;s what <code>itertools.islice</code> is for.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>max_sum_subsequence_stream()</code> may be more useful to clients than <code>max_sum_subsequence()</code>. Suppose, for example, we&#8217;re only interested when the maximum sum subsequence exceeds 100. We can do this directly by connecting <code>itertools.dropwhile()</code> to our function.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">def max_subseq_exceeds(seq, limit=100):
    max_sub_s = max_sum_subsequence_stream(seq)
    return itertools.dropwhile(lambda s: s &lt;= limit, max_sub_s)

</pre>

</div>

<p>Perhaps we&#8217;d like to know if the maximum sum subsequence reaches a plateau; that is, it stays on a level for a while.

 <li><p>The maximum sum contiguous subsequence problem is described in <a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/pearls/">&#8220;Programming Pearls&#8221;</a> by Jon Bentley. 
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>My favourite introduction to computer programming, &#8220;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&#8221;, has <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-24.html#%_sec_3.5">lots to say about streams</a>, and suggests they have a role in concurrent programming and modelling time. 
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Streams are a natural fit with functional programming, and well supported by languages like <a href="http://www.schemers.org">Scheme</a> and <a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a>. Python also handles them nicely: look into <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">generators</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/">generator expressions</a>, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-itertools.html">itertools module</a>, and study <code>test_generators.py</code> carefully.
