<h3><a href="#toc0" name="tocintroduction" id="tocintroduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>We have all seen comments in source files which look more like executable code
   than documentation.
</p>
<p>The first line in the body of the <code>for</code> loop below is such a comment: you might
   expect to be able to remove the leading slashes and have code which compiles
   and runs but functions slightly differently.
</p>
<p>What did the author of this comment intend?
</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Example 0</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">for (Surfaces::iterator sf = surfaces.begin();
     sf != surfaces.end(); 
     ++sf) {
     // std::cout &lt;&lt; "Drawing: " &lt;&lt; *sf &lt;&lt; "\n";
     sf-&gt;draw();
}

</pre>

</div>

<p>OK, I&#8217;m being disingenuous. I&#8217;m aware that the comment isn&#8217;t really a comment,
   it&#8217;s commented-out code. And, like any tolerant and capable programmer, by
   examining the surrounding context I can guess why this code has been commented
   out.
</p>
<p>This article examines how to comment-out code, then describes various problems
   which lead to code being commented out, before finally arguing that there&#8217;s
   often a better solution to these problems.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc1" name="tochow-to-commentout-code" id="tochow-to-commentout-code">How to Comment-Out Code</a></h3>
<p>Usually it&#8217;s as simple as using your editor to select a region then
   instructing it to comment out that region.
</p>
<p>If using C-style comments &#8212; by which I mean comments delimited by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>
   &#8212; then bear in mind they do not nest, so you may run into problems with real
   comments in the code you want to comment out, or even with commenting-out code
   which has already been commented-out.
</p>
<p>I came to C++ from a C background, and remember attending a training course at
   which the presenter pointed out how easy it was to comment out C++ comments
   using C comments:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">/*
for (Surfaces::iterator sf = surfaces.begin();
     sf != surfaces.end(); 
     ++sf) {
     // std::cout &lt;&lt; "Drawing: " &lt;&lt; *sf &lt;&lt; "\n";
     sf-&gt;draw();
}
*/

</pre>

</div>

<p>Oh dear!
</p>
<p>If your editor&#8217;s syntax highlighting makes it obvious that the whole loop is
   commented out, great. Would it still be obvious if, for example, you were
   paging through the source file on a remote computer? Or if you
   were code-reviewing a printed version of the file? Or if you had hit
   a commented-out line while searching? Or even if you were at a customer site and
   didn&#8217;t have access to your favourite editor?
</p>
<p>The more useful thing to say about C++ comments is that they run from where
   they start until the end of the line, and therefore do not suffer from this
   nesting problem. So a C++ comment can be commented out by a C++ comment!
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">// for (Surfaces::iterator sf = surfaces.begin();
//     sf != surfaces.end(); 
//    ++sf) {
//    // std::cout &lt;&lt; "Drawing: " &lt;&lt; *sf &lt;&lt; "\n";
//    sf-&gt;draw();
// }

</pre>

</div>

<p>If using C-style comments, then the following style makes it clear which lines
   are part of the comment:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">/* for (Surfaces::iterator sf = surfaces.begin();
 *     sf != surfaces.end(); 
 *    ++sf) {
 *    // std::cout &lt;&lt; "Drawing: " &lt;&lt; *sf &lt;&lt; "\n";
 *    sf-&gt;draw();
 * }
 */

</pre>

</div>

<p>If your editor does not allow you to easily comment out a lengthy region of
   code in this way then either use a better editor or read the rest of this
   article and consdier whether commenting out the code is really what&#8217;s required.
</p>
<p>A more heavy duty way to stop a block of code from executing is to instruct
   the preprocessor to skip past it.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">#if 0
    for (Surfaces::iterator sf = surfaces.begin();
         sf != surfaces.end(); 
         ++sf) {
         // std::cout &lt;&lt; "Drawing: " &lt;&lt; *sf &lt;&lt; "\n";
         sf-&gt;draw();
    }
#endif

</pre>

</div>

<p>If this technique is used, the preprocessed-out code blends perfectly with the
   executable code. Even syntax-highlighting does not expose the fact that the
   code will not be executed.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc2" name="tocmore-examples" id="tocmore-examples">More Examples</a></h3>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Example 1</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">void Session::registerClient(Client const &amp; /* client */) {
    // if (!registered(client)) {
    //     m_clients.push_back(client)
    // }
}

</pre>

</div>

<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Example 2</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">switch (table_selector) {
    case table0:
         /* convertTable0(data);
         break; */
    case table1:
         convertTable1(data);
         break;
    ....
}

</pre>

<h3><a href="#toc3" name="tocwhy-commentout-code" id="tocwhy-commentout-code">Why Comment-Out code?</a></h3>
<p>The obvious answer &#8212; to stop it from executing &#8212; begs the further questions:
   Why should the code not execute? Did it ever execute? Will it ever execute?
   There are several possibilities:
</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>The commented-out code has been superceded by something better, but the
      author of the new code wants the old code to stick around for a while,
      perhaps as a reference, perhaps out of historical interest, or perhaps
      because the new code might not turn out to be better after all.
     <br />
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Commenting the code out appears to fix a bug, but noone understands
      why &#8212; hence the old code is left in comments.
      <br />
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>The code was commented out during an experiment, maybe an attempt to
      reproduce a bug, and should never actually have been checked-in in such
      a state. In other words, a bug has been introduced: in fact the code
      should still be executed.
      <br />
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>The source file belongs to a third party library which has required
      modifications to work in-house. The lines which have been commented out
      represent the source code in its original form.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>The commented-out code produces irritatingly verbose debug diagnostics
      which needed silencing.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>The commented-out code represents work-in-progess which the author has
      sensibly checked in to the source repository for safe keeping.
</p>

 </li>
</ol>
<p>These are all reasons for turning code into comments, some more reasonable
   than others. Categorising our examples: Example 0) appears to be silenced debug,
   Example 1) work in progress, and Example 2) a hacked-up experiment &#8212; though we
   really cannot be sure. Example 2) might equally well remove the symptoms (if
   not the cause) of a bug and Example 1) might represent a superceded method.
</p>
<p>The important point is that unless the author of the commented-out code
   explains what&#8217;s intended, it is impossible for future readers to accurately
   guess. How, then, should the author explain? With a comment!
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">for (Surfaces::iterator sf = surfaces.begin();
     sf != surfaces.end(); 
     ++sf) {
     // std::cout &lt;&lt; "Drawing: " &lt;&lt; *sf &lt;&lt; "\n";
     // Work in progress. Surface stream output not yet implemented.
     // Thomas Guest, 12-Dec-2003.
     sf-&gt;draw();
}

</pre>

</div>

<p>Depending on circumstance, the comment might read:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">// Do not inflict verbose debug output on everyone.
// Thomas Guest, 12-Dec-2003.

</pre>

</div>

<pre><code>
</code></pre><p>or even:
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">// Commenting out the above line of code appears to cure the
// random crashes reported as PR666. I am not yet sure why,
// but am leaving the code commented out while I investigate.
// Thomas Guest, 12-Dec-2003.

</pre>

</div>

<p>I have included an explicit name and date in the comment &#8212; redundant data,
   strictly speaking, since they duplicate information held in the source
   management system &#8212; because I do not intend the code to persist in its
   current state. The comment has a sell-by date. Anyone reading it will
   immediately understand what&#8217;s going on and who to hassle if they don&#8217;t like
   it.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc4" name="tocwhy-commenting-out-code-is-a-bad-idea" id="tocwhy-commenting-out-code-is-a-bad-idea">Why Commenting Out Code is a Bad Idea</a></h3>
<p>Commented-out code &#8212; like any other comment &#8212; ages badly. It needs
   maintaining if it is to remain in a state where it can be uncommented and
   compiled, should the need arise, and of course it won&#8217;t be maintained in this
   way since the need is unlikely to arise. There is more than enough live code
   to maintain without devoting attention to half-dead code in comments.
</p>
<p>Once code has been commented out it becomes hard to remove: someone at some
   point obviously thought the code worth leaving in, so future programmers working
   on the file honour that decision, although they may well consider the code
   smells a bit off &#8212; code which someone once found problems with, attempted
   to cure, never really got to the bottom of, and left for someone else to sort
   out, or, more than likely, ignore.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc5" name="tocwhat-to-do-instead" id="tocwhat-to-do-instead">What to do Instead</a></h3>
<p>The source management system is the proper home for old versions of source
   code. If, for some reason, it really seems necessary to explicitly note
   that an alternative version of the current code once existed, then
   this can be indicated using indirection.
</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">// Previously, surfaces were stored in a vector, not a list.
// A list is now used to support efficient splicing.
// Refer to version 1.22 of this file for the vector implementation.

</pre>

</div>

<p>There is a direct parallel with the change history of a document: at times it
   may be very useful to review who changed what, when, or to examine
   side-by-side differences with the previous version of the document, but this is
   achieved by accessing the document&#8217;s revision history, not by leaving obsolete
   wording lying around in strike-through style.  The up-to-date version of the
   document should be up-to-date.
</p>
<p>Ideally, then, the dead code can be cut away. To achieve this ideal requires
   proper use of the source management system. Check-in comments should be of the
   same standard as any other project documentation &#8212; they need to be clear,
   accurate, and must include relevant cross-references (to bug report numbers,
   for example). An iterative approach to check-ins works well: i.e. take the
   code in steps towards its new form, checking in after each step is complete.
</p>
<p>We may not be dealing with dead code, though. Perhaps the code represents work
   in progress &#8212; functions which are being written and which do not yet work,
   but which none-the-less belong in the source code repository. In this case,
   the code needs to indicate why it has been commented out, as already
   mentioned. An alternative would be to store the developing code on a branch
   until it matures.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if the commented-out code represents the original content of a
   third-party file, then an in-line explanation is required to make this evident
   to anyone inspecting that file. Even in this situation, I would argue the
   original content should be cut and the source control system used to manage
   the differences.
</p>
<p>Debug output often gets commented-out because it degrades performance or fills
   up screens. In this case, either the debug code really was a one-off, and
   should be deleted after use, or it should be carefully integrated into the
   trace system (the trace system being the module which provides the facility
   to efficiently filter logged output at run time).
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc6" name="tocconclusions" id="tocconclusions">Conclusions</a></h3>
<p>What would happen if you were to cut commented-out code from your
   source tree? My guess is that you would have significantly less code to
   maintain, that much of the remaining code would be cleaner (and therefore
   easier to maintain), that old versions of code would remain accessible, and
   that functionality and efficiency would be unaltered.
