<p>Every so often a new essay hits the top of the programming news sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>why I&#8217;m rewriting <a href="http://250bpm.com/blog:4" title="Why should I have written ZeroMQ in C, not C++">X in C</a> (and abandoning C++)</li>
<li>why we will never use C++ for Y (which has always been written in C)</li>
<li>why C++ is a <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57643/focus=57918" title="Torvalds rants about C++">horrible language</a> (it isn&#8217;t C)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for these articles and have some sympathy with them. Every so often I work with C code rather than C++, and find the experience refreshing: rapid compilation, clear build diagnostics, comprehensible APIs, easy debugging, and an agreeable reduction in layering and punctuation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always easy to return to C because it hasn&#8217;t really changed. Well, it <strong>has</strong> changed, conservatively, and C programmers seem conservative in adopting new features.</p>
<p>By contrast, C++ <strong>does</strong> change. Sure, C++0X was a long time coming &#8212; finally realised as C++11 &#8212; but since that giant step, smaller improvements continue apace. As a result C++ code soon looks stale. Every time I visit a source file it seems I have to freshen it, using the new way to prevent copying, or return containers, or manage resources, or pass functions, or &#8230; you get the idea.</p>
<p>The truth is, every substantial C++ codebase I&#8217;ve worked on reads like a history of C++. Somewhere low down there&#8217;ll be hand-written intrusive linked lists; then there&#8217;ll be a few layers of classes, some nested for good measure; then templates, <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a>, functions disguised as classes for use in algorithms; and finally the good stuff, in which auto, lambda, move semantics and intialisers allow us to code as we&#8217;ve always wanted.</p>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/blast.html">defends C++ on his website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As someone remarked: There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that &#8220;someone&#8221; wasn&#8217;t Stroustrup, it is now &#8212; he has become the source of his own quotation. His point is that C++ is well-used and must therefore be bitched about.</p>
<p>C provides an immediate counter-example, however. It is undeniably used, but its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Traps_and_Pitfalls">traps and pitfalls</a> are known and respected, rather than bitched about.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, I find C too limited. The lack of standard containers and algorithms combined with the overheads of heap management and ubiquitous error checking make programming in C heavy going.</p>
<p>C++ is hard to learn and hard to keep up with. The language has grown, considerably, but the progression is necessary. It&#8217;s the more recent extensions which fully realise the power of the standard template library, for example. Stick with C++. The reward will be code which is expressive and efficient.</p>
