<p>I needed to investigate character code points beyond the <a href="http://unicode.org">Unicode</a>
basic multilingual plane. As usual <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> was the tool I reached for first
&#8212; well, not quite first, since I&#8217;d already leafed through the
introductory sections of the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/book/aboutbook.html">Unicode book</a>, in which I noticed the
following <a href="http://www.unicode.org/press/quotations.html#rossum">encouraging words</a> from Python&#8217;s inventor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Modern programs must handle Unicode &#8212; Python has excellent support
for Unicode, and will keep getting better.&#8221; &#8212; Guido van Rossum</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I can fully agree with the <em>excellent support</em> bit of
this quotation: <span id="excerpt0"/>in this case, I had to put in the batteries myself.</p>
<p><span id="continue-reading"/></p>
<h4 id="legacy-systems">Legacy Systems</h4>
<p>Incidentally, I agree with the BDFL and the many others who are
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/press/quotations.html">on record</a> as saying that <a href="http://unicode.org">Unicode</a> is both necessary and great. It&#8217;s
just a shame it didn&#8217;t happen sooner, because we now have any number
of legacy systems which make a poor fist of things &#8212; C++&#8217;s built in
<code>wchar_t</code> being a typically half-baked solution.</p>
<p>(Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a <code>wchar_t</code> suitable for Unicode characters?</li>
<li>Can a <code>std:wstring</code> help us write international applications in a portable way?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the best way to handle text data in a C++ program?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe.</li>
<li>Probably not.</li>
<li>Watch this space.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="narrow-builds">Narrow builds</h4>
<p>As I write this, the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> installed on my machine &#8212; and indeed on
all the machines I have access to &#8212; behaves as follows:</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">narrow python problems</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">&gt;&gt;&gt; help(unichr)
Help on built-in function unichr in module __builtin__:

unichr(...)
    unichr(i) -&gt; Unicode character

    Return a Unicode string of one character with
    ordinal i; 0 &lt;= i &lt;= 0x10ffff.

&gt;&gt;&gt; uc = unichr(0x10000)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x10000) (narrow Python build)

</pre>

</div>

<p>The error message suggested I&#8217;d need to <em>rebuild</em> Python to make it
behave.  I didn&#8217;t really want to do this, so I tried a bit of
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=python+narrow">googling</a>
in case it found me a more favourable answer (it didn&#8217;t). I had a closer
look at what <code>python -h</code> had to tell me in case I could supply a <code>-wide</code>
option (I couldn&#8217;t). I even wondered if the <code>pythonw</code> which lives alongside
<code>python</code> might be just what I wanted (it wasn&#8217;t).</p>
<h4 id="wide-builds">Wide builds</h4>
<p>Finally, I decided I&#8217;d have to rebuild Python after all. For the
record, here&#8217;s what you do:</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Building a wide version Python</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ tar xjf Python-2.5.tar.bz2
$ cd Python-2.5
$ ./configure --enable-unicode=ucs4 &amp;&amp; make

</pre>

</div>

<p>No, it&#8217;s not that hard, once you&#8217;ve read <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0261/">PEP 261</a>, which
explains the <code>configure</code> options. You&#8217;ll have to work out for yourself
if and where you want to install this new and flabby version of Python,
which &#8212; <em>shock!, horror!!</em> &#8212; doubles the memory used for most Unicode
strings.</p>
<h4 id="loss-of-power">Loss of power</h4>
<p>For once, I&#8217;m disappointed in Python. The
default build provides weakened support for Unicode, which in some
ways is worse than no support for Unicode. Why? Because the language
<em>appears</em> to support Unicode, but is likely to let you down if you
ever venture past the safe region of the basic multilingual plane
&#8212; the kind of unwelcome surprise which experienced programmers
rightly fear.  And because the behaviour you see on a wide build differs from
the behaviour you get on a narrow build.  Worse again, Python is
perfectly able to support the full Unicode standard, if you&#8217;re
prepared to trade in a bit of memory for compliance. This is the kind
of trade-off Python users are usually more than happy to accept. If
and when they need to get closer to the silicon, they just use C.</p>
<h4 id="hope">Hope</h4>
<p>Of course Guido van Rossum did say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Python has excellent support
for Unicode, and <em>will keep getting better</em>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine). This looks like one particular area where support could be
better. I&#8217;ve seen hints that C++0X (which may well end up becoming
C++1X) will place improved Unicode support into the standard language, but
I&#8217;d bet Python will stay ahead by a comfortable margin.</p>

<p>This is so intriguing!</p>

<p>Guido has many splendid qualities, but identifying (or at least admitting) to weaknesses in Python isn't one of them.  That said, I don't think any language that I've used supports Unicode in an "excellent" way, certainly not outside the BMP.  </p>

<p>I'm extremely curious as to what you were doing out beyond the BMP.  Student of ancient history perhaps?  Or merely curious?</p>

<p>I'll be watching for whatever you propose for text handling in C++ too.  Years ago, I was involved in proposing a book with almost exactly that title - "International text handling in C++".  It didn't proceed, which is probably a good thing because I'm pretty sure now I'd have completely ballsed it up.  I've persued this subject with vigour since then, but it's still something I'm interested in.  If you've got code, I'd love to see it.</p>

<p>I disagree. The whole Python 3000 thing is about cleaning up design errors before they become entrenched.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I've never had to explore there before, so I couldn't really comment. What I saw of Java looked very good, though. Surely a newer language such as C# also gets things right? </p>

<p>Sorry, I have no proposal and no code I can show. I just recall reading somewhere -- probably the CVu standards report -- that improved support for Unicode was on the C++0X agenda. </p>

<p>Apologies for raising your hopes. When I wrote "watch this space" I should really have said "wait and see what the C++ standards committee come up with".</p>

<p>Actually, Python's support for Unicode is starting to grow on me, though I still think the variant builds are unfortunate. Support for various other text encodings is <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/standard-encodings.html" rel="nofollow">extremely good</a>. </p>

<p>My general recommendation for text conversion utilities and similar in C++ is to use Python to generate the required C++. <a href="http://wordaligned.org/metaprogramming/metaprogramming_is_your_friend/scripting.html" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> a simple example of what I mean.</p>
