<h3 id="choose-talks">Choose Talks</h3>
<p>I usually leave it as late as possible before deciding which sessions to attend at the <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2015">ACCU conference</a>. There&#8217;s ample time to study the <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2015/accu2015_schedule">schedule</a> when you&#8217;re there and anyway, it&#8217;s subject to change.</p>
<p>This year I stuck with this policy with a couple of notable exceptions. First, there was <a href="/docs/oulipo/">my own talk</a>, where I noted that computer programmers are writers who impose formal constraints on their texts, and who can learn from other writers who practice the same discipline. Second, there was Peter Hilton&#8217;s talk, <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2015/accu2015_sessions#how_to_name_things_-_the_hardest_problem_in_programming">&#8220;How to name things &#8212; the hardest problem in programming&#8221;</a>, in which he argued more generally that programmers had much to learn from writers.</p>
<p>I <strong>had</strong> to see Peter Hilton&#8217;s talk and it did not disappoint. It engaged me at the time, in discussions afterwards, and it continues to make me think. I won&#8217;t post a full response here but I do want to consider one aspect: humour.</p>

<h3 id="tell-jokes">Tell Jokes</h3>
<p>Peter Hilton argued we should pay attention to tips from the likes of George Orwell and Stephen King because their advice is better written and also because it&#8217;s <strong>funnier</strong>. Why does this humourous aspect matter? Well, perhaps we&#8217;re more likely to listen to someone who makes us laugh. Witty advice sounds less pompous.</p>
<p>It goes deeper than this, though. Another point from the talk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improve your general vocabulary. Read books, especially funny novels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why <strong>funny novels</strong>? At this point in the talk Peter Hilton disingenously suggested such books were easier to read. A point he made later goes deeper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell jokes &#8230; Puns are important for naming, because they rely on double-meanings. Spotting double-meanings is the essential skill for avoiding ambiguous names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting! I agree that word play and word power are linked: but do you need to be a punster to avoid ambiguity? I&#8217;m not sure. In the words of <a href="http://chrisoldwood.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/the-daily-stand-up.html">Chris Oldwood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing more functional code lately. I recently tried a few numerical recipes with currying functions, but all I got was a NaN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naan"><img src="/images/naan.jpg" alt="all I got was a NaN"/></a></p>
<h3 id="laughable-code">Laughable Code</h3>
<p>Is there a place for humour in code? Rarely, I&#8217;d say. Code is read,
re-read and then read again: most jokes become tired and then
irritating under such scrutiny. Peter Hilton, though, described his
amusement on discovering this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pirhilton/how-to-name-things-the-hardest-problem-in-programming/55">function</a>, which configures
and starts <a href="http://camel.apache.org/">Apache Camel</a>:</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">/** Configure and start Apache Camel */
def mountCamel() {
    Logger.info("Starting Camel...")
    val context = new DefaultCamelContext()
    configuredRoutes foreach { route =&gt;
        context.addRoutes(route)
    }
    context.start()
}

</pre>

</div>

<p>The obvious alternative, <code>startCamel()</code>, just isn&#8217;t funny enough, apparently. I&#8217;m glad the author resisted the temptation to call it <code>humpCamel()</code>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reminded of a colleague with a fondness for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franglais">franglais</a> who
would, for example, check in a graphics routine called
<code>do_le_render()</code>. Mildly amusing first time round, maybe, but less so
each time it got revisited to fix les bugs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ahmedrabea/7929947448" title="Ark of Desert - Camel by Ahmed Rabea, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/7929947448_06dd57700c_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Ark of Desert - Camel"/></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see many jokes in the code I read and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s
because the authors lack a sense of humour. Just as <a href="/articles/entertaining-documentation" title="Entertaining documentation">good
documentation should inform rather than entertain</a>, good code
should express complex ideas as plainly as possible: humour doesn&#8217;t
get a look in.</p>
<p>There are exceptions. We&#8217;ve already seen the name &#8220;camel&#8221; used for something which isn&#8217;t a camel: libraries, products and projects can benefit from short, memorable and quirky names. In unit tests, too, code is less complex, which can leave space for quips and in-jokes. When an integer is expected it often turns out to be <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?q=the%20answer%20to%20life%20the%20universe%20and%20everything">42</a>. Binary input data is laid out to form strange messages when viewed as <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/hexwords.html">hexadecimal</a>. If some text &#8212; any old text &#8212; is needed, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">lorem ipsum</a> would indicate a lack of imagination. Even so, well-chosen names and values from the domain under test would probably be more helpful when a failing test needs fixing.</p>
<h3 id="charming-code">Charming code</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m down on jokes in code but I do think code can be a pleasure to read and that well written programs can delight. Whilst I agree with Peter Hilton&#8217;s recommendation to read widely and well, I was surprised he didn&#8217;t recommend reading <strong>code</strong>, and when I discussed this with him afterwards he asked, where is it? Where is it! That will be the subject of another article, but off the top of my head, <a href="http://www.freetype.org">freetype</a>, <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>, <a href="http://llvm.org/">llvm</a>, the Go and Python standard libraries. If you read through any of these you&#8217;ll enjoy their clarity and internal consistency &#8212; their style; and should you code against them, these same attributes show through their interfaces.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t found any jokes in the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> source but if you decide
to integrate it in your application, when you check the license you&#8217;ll
find, instead, a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/different.html">blessing</a>. This may seem funny &#8212; unusual,
certainly &#8212; but it&#8217;s actually quite serious.</p>
<blockquote><p>May you do good and not evil<br/>
May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others<br/>
May you share freely, never taking more than you give.</p></blockquote>

<p>We may not issue blessings with our own code but maybe we can find other ways to surprise and delight.</p>
