</div><p>I&#8217;ve worked at more than one organisation where a retrospective
   attempt has been made to set up a coding standard. This article
   discusses why these attempts were made and how they went.
</p>
<span id="continue-reading"/>


<h3><a href="#toc0" name="tocwhat-no-coding-standards" id="tocwhat-no-coding-standards">What, No Coding Standards!?</a></h3>
<p>When I say &#8220;a retrospective attempt&#8221;, I mean that plenty of code had
   already been written &#8212; over a number of years, in fact &#8212; with no
   existing coding standard in place. Is this a bad thing? Not
   necessarily. Joel Spolsky&#8217;s 12 point <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">checklist</a> on how to
   write better code is generally sound, and in particular I think he
   does well to <strong>not</strong> say:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do you have a Coding Standard, and does everyone follow it?&#8221;
</p>
</blockquote><p>In the cases I&#8217;m describing the code was in no way sub-standard. It
   worked well. Its success had caused the team to grow, with all the
   consequent problems, and in fact it wasn&#8217;t management who imposed
   a coding standard, but the developers themselves who decided they 
   wanted one.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc1" name="tocloss-of-freedom" id="tocloss-of-freedom">Loss of Freedom</a></h3>
<p><span id="excerpt0"/>A good coding standard shouldn&#8217;t be there to constrain developers or force
   them to comply to a particular coding style. In fact, most seasoned
   programmers are careful not to waste energy arguing about coding
   styles (which isn&#8217;t to say we don&#8217;t care, or don&#8217;t have opinions
   on such matters &#8212; it&#8217;s just that we prefer not to waste energy).
</p>
<p>For this very reason, a coding standard can help. By drawing a line
   under arguments about where to place braces, how far to indent, what
   to call things, and then moving on, we allow ourselves to concentrate
   on solving more interesting problems. Even better, if everyone adopts
   a consistent style, it becomes easier to work with code written
   by colleagues.
</p>
<p>The term &#8220;Coding Standards&#8221; suggests rules and red tape. It&#8217;s perhaps
   the most common term, which is why I&#8217;ve been using it, but I think
   guidelines are what are really required. In fact, as I&#8217;ll explain, we
   don&#8217;t really need guidelines since the experts have already written
   them for us. A &#8220;Style Guide&#8221; describing local conventions should be
   quite enough.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc2" name="tocask-the-experts" id="tocask-the-experts">Ask the Experts</a></h3>
<p>All too often a corporate coding standard reads as an attempt by a
   local expert to lay down rules on how to write good code: when to use
   exceptions, why to pass arguments by constant reference, when to use
   protected data members, etc.  At best, this is a waste of effort, and,
   more likely (unless <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/">Herb Sutter</a> or <a href="http://www.aristeia.com/">Scott Meyers</a>
   happens to be your local expert), there&#8217;s a high probability these
   home-brewed rules will be wrong.
</p>
<p><span id="excerpt1"/>It&#8217;s far better to provide a well-stocked library than to attempt
   to write your own diluted imitations of Sutter and Meyers.
</p>
<p>What <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/">Sutter</a> and <a href="http://www.aristeia.com/">Meyers</a> can&#8217;t do, though, is document your
   local coding style &#8212; by which I mean those finickity things such as
   what &copy; copyright notice goes in a header file, where braces get
   placed, how far to indent, how to name things. That&#8217;s what goes in
   your Style Guide.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc3" name="tocsmall-stuff" id="tocsmall-stuff">Small Stuff</a></h3>
<p>The Style Guide, then, will comprise entirely of what 
   <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c++cs.htm">Sutter and Alexandrescu</a>
   refer to as &#8220;small stuff&#8221;, about which their specific advice is:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Item 0. Don&#8217;t sweat the small stuff.
</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c++cs.htm">C++ Coding Standards</a>, Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu
</p>
</blockquote><p>By this they mean:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Issues that are really just personal taste and don&#8217;t affect correctness
   don&#8217;t belong in a coding standard. Any professional programmer can easily
   read and write code that is formatted a little differently than they&#8217;re
   used to.
</p>
</blockquote><p>Does this imply that even a Style Guide isn&#8217;t worth writing? And if so,
   why ever did the team I was working on want one?
</p>
<p>I agree with Sutter and Alexandrescu&#8217;s headline advice, but my take on
   it is slightly different: yes, small stuff isn&#8217;t worth fussing over;
   and yes, I&#8217;m capable of resetting my tabwidth to edit a file, and even
   of adopting the brace placement rules and naming conventions in force
   in that file &#8212; but it requires concentration and becomes
   tiresome. What if there are several conflicting styles in a single
   file? I prefer to work on a consistent code base, and so do most
   programmers I&#8217;ve worked with. So some sweating turns out to be
   necessary!
</p>
<p>In this same section, 
   <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c++cs.htm">Sutter and Alexandrescu</a> manage to
   define a sensible naming convention in a single paragraph: this
   demonstrates the level of detail we&#8217;re looking for. An entire Style
   Guide should fit comfortably on a single page, otherwise 
   it&#8217;s too fussy and won&#8217;t be adopted.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc4" name="tocreuse" id="tocreuse">Re-Use</a></h3>
<p>I hope we&#8217;ve agreed to resist the temptation to write our own feeble
   imitations of 
   <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c++cs.htm">&#8220;C++ Coding Standards&#8221;</a>, 
   <a href="http://www.aristeia.com/books_frames.html">&#8220;Effective C++&#8221;</a>, 
   and similar. Out-sourcing this kind of thing is appealing. Surely we 
   could also reuse a coding style we&#8217;ve seen elsewhere?
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc5" name="toclanguage-conventions" id="toclanguage-conventions">Language Conventions</a></h3>
<p>Up to now I&#8217;ve avoided explicitly mentioned what programming language
   I&#8217;m talking about. If the language were <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java</a>,
   then defining our Style Guide really shouldn&#8217;t be an issue: we&#8217;d just
   cross-reference the 
   <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">Sun Java Programming Conventions</a>, 
   configure an <a href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/">Eclipse plugin</a> 
   to enforce these conventions, share the configuration
   and be done with it.
</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> has a reasonably well-defined
   preferred style &#8212; and its famous space-sensitivity unasks most
   questions about code layout.
</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s C++ we&#8217;re talking about, the ground rules are less clear, and
   there&#8217;s a whole lot more syntax to fret about. Nonetheless, we could
   draw inspiration from the C++ Standard Library, which follows a
   consistent &#8212; if not formally documented &#8212; naming style. This is exactly
   what <a href="http//boost.org">Boost</a> has chosen to do, and indeed parts of <a href="http//boost.org">Boost</a> are already
   making their way into the C++ Library. Many of the Boost
   <a href="http://boost.org/more/lib_guide.htm#Guidelines">guidelines</a> are specific to the Boost project, but we could
   sensibly extract the short sections on naming and layout to form the
   basis of our own Style Guide.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Use the naming conventions of the C++ Standard Library (See Naming
   conventions rationale): 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     Names (except as noted below) should be all lowercase, with words separated by underscores.  <br />
 </li>

 <li>
     Acronyms should be treated as ordinary names (e.g. xml_parser instead of XML_parser).  <br />
 </li>

 <li>
     Template parameter names begin with an uppercase letter.  <br />
 </li>

 <li>
     Macro (gasp!) names all uppercase and begin with BOOST_.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Choose meaningful names &#8212; explicit is better than implicit, and
   readability counts. There is a strong preference for clear and
   descriptive names, even if lengthy.  <br />
</p>
<p>&#8230;  <br />
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     Use fixed-width fonts.
 </li>

 <li>
     Use spaces rather than tabs.
 </li>

 <li>
     Limit line lengths to 80 characters.
 </li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>Of course, if we&#8217;re retro-fitting a style guide, it&#8217;s unlikely that we
   can just cut and paste the relevant sections of the Boost one. Another
   great site is Sven Rosvall&#8217;s 
   <a href="http://www.rosvall.ie/CSG/">Coding Standard Generator</a>, 
   which allows you to generate your own coding standard by filling out a few forms.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc6" name="tocthe-legacy-issue" id="tocthe-legacy-issue">The Legacy Issue</a></h3>
<p>What if, having got together our one page Style Guide, we find that,
   say, only 50% the codebase fits that style? This is a serious concern,
   and one which threatens the usefulness of the whole exercise.
</p>
<p>A Style Guide is supposed to make things easier for new team members
   to pick things up &#8212; but if they discover little of the codebase
   follows the guide, then they&#8217;ll ignore it like everyone else seems
   to. Similarly, experienced team members will resent effort spent on
   writing a guide which only looks good on paper, and will ignore
   it too.
</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no easy way to tackle this issue, but there are a few viable
   approaches:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     Relax the style guide. By loosening it to accomodate everything,
        everything conforms.
 </li>

 <li>
     Refactor the entire codebase to meet the accepted style.
 </li>

 <li>
     When working on a file, first refactor it to meet the accepted style.
 </li>
</ol>
<p>General C++ refactorings &#8212; to change the name of a class, for example
   &#8212; can be surprisingly difficult to automate and guarantee. The
   complexity of the language and its compilation model makes sure of
   that. Nonetheless, it can be done if the benefits are judged
   worthwhile. If you&#8217;re worried that changing code will break it, then
   you probably don&#8217;t have a good suite of regression tests: setting up
   and automating such a suite is <em>far</em> more important than code style
   issues.
</p>
<p>Simple refactorings &#8212; to expand tabs to spaces, or to eliminate
   unwanted 
   <a href="/articles/keyword-substitution-just-say-no.html">Subversion keywords</a>
    &#8212; are easier to apply. Once done,
   they can be enforced using 
   <a href="/articles/a-subversion-pre-commit-hook.html">hook scripts</a>.
</p>
<p>In practice, a balance between the listed approaches combined with a
   good dose of common sense provides our only way forward. The Style
   Guide should be a living document which always reflects the current
   code base. As is so often the case, we can iterate to get where we want,
   starting from: step zero, no style guide, anything goes.
