<p>I didn&#8217;t get to use Java until relatively recently in my programming
career. <span id="excerpt0"/>As a C++ programmer brought up on C, I suppose I suffered the
usual prejudice: that Java would be a feeble language designed to stop
feeble programmers from getting hurt too badly. The truth turned out
to be rather different.</p>
<p><span id="continue-reading"/></p>
<h3 id="garbage-collection">Garbage collection</h3>
<p>One headline difference between Java and C++ is of course garbage
collection. On the face of it, C++ provides the best of all worlds:
there are <a href="http://boost.org/libs/smart_ptr/index.html">techniques</a> to precisely encapsulate resource lifecycle;
there are <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/">libraries</a> you can get hold of to collect garbage for you; and, finally, it looks like <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n2129.pdf">C++09 will include garbage collection</a>.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that the techniques I mention aren&#8217;t as widely used
as they should be. It&#8217;s hard to blame C++ programmers because the
various smart pointer classes haven&#8217;t yet been formally standardised
and most C++ books fail to mention them (and the one smart pointer
which did make it into the standard library is notoriously
slippery). So we&#8217;ll have to wait for C++09, roll our own, or get hold of a TR1 implementation &#8212; and without considerable discipline there&#8217;s
nothing to stop rogue programmers on the team using <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>
as a high-level interface to heap management.</p>
<p>Garbage collection <a href="http://www.octopull.demon.co.uk/java/ImmortalityAtaPrice.html">doesn&#8217;t release programmers from thinking about
the way a program uses resources</a>, but it sure does release us
from some tiresome defects. Running a program though
<a href="http://valgrind.org">valgrind</a> (or similar) doesn&#8217;t prove it&#8217;s clean.</p>
<h3 id="runtime-errors">Runtime Errors</h3>
<p>Similarly, Java throws runtime errors as soon as it detects problems C++ may not even notice. If you try and read past the end of an array or access a non-existent object, the runtime signals the error soon as it happens. No need for forensic investigation to figure out what trashed the stack.</p>
<p>The C++ counter-argument is that this kind of checking <em>costs</em>. You have to be pretty dumb to try and read past the end of an array, so why ever pay for a safety check on every array access?  It only took a couple of <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>s to disabuse me of this notion. Dumb checks save time, especially the ones the programmer doesn&#8217;t have to write; excluding them on the grounds of perceived cost counts as premature optimisation.</p>
<h3 id="verbosity">Verbosity</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, though, if you write Java, you usually have to write a lot of it. I&#8217;ll repeat <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>&#8217;s joke about the Java implementation of &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221;.</p>
<div class="typocode"><div class="codetitle">Hello, World!</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}

</pre>

</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone who has never written a program probably looks at this and
wonders, why do you need to say so much to get the the computer to
print a message? Curiously, the reaction of experienced programmers
is identical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An IDE will write a lot of this for you (and Java is rightly famous for its associated IDEs) but you&#8217;ll still have to read it every time you visit the file. Programs are read more often than they&#8217;re written.</p>
<h3 id="the-march-of-ides">The March of IDEs</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit that refactoring IDEs can be useful. If you have to use Java, use a refactoring IDE to keep your code in shape. The relative simplicity of the Java syntax and compilation model means that a Java IDE is always going to be one step ahead of a C++ one for this kind of thing.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of IDEs, I&#8217;ve also noticed some <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2007/02/01/making_sense_ruby/">grumbling</a> about the lack of such IDEs for high-level dynamic languages such as Ruby and Python.  If a variable&#8217;s type isn&#8217;t declared when a program is being written, how&#8217;s an IDE going to auto-complete the methods supported by that variable? I&#8217;m not an IDE designer, but the solution to this would seem to me to be to merge the interpreter and the editor: that is, run and write the program at the same time. If I&#8217;m in the Python interpreter, I can just use <code>dir</code> to tell me what&#8217;s available.</p>
<h3 id="in-java-everything-is-an-object">In Java, everything is an Object</h3>
<p>Everything except the built in types, that is. Java couldn&#8217;t quite go the whole way: if it&#8217;s going to compete with C and C++, it&#8217;ll have to measure up on performance, and that seems to mean fixed-width built in types. At least Java <em>does</em> have and always has had an official eight byte long integer, meaning that, for example, millisecond clock values won&#8217;t wrap in the lifetime of this planet.</p>
<p>The downside of making everything an object is that few application domains can be modelled in this way. Sure, a windows-based user interface maps nicely to an object hierarchy, but when you get into the core application engine, you&#8217;re likely to find yourself mapping, filtering and reducing collections &#8212; a more functional style programming. C++ provides far more power here: I&#8217;m reluctant to say it does better, because any heavy use of the STL and templated code requires lengthy build times and a willingness to unpick hideous compilation errors.</p>
<h3 id="compilation">Compilation</h3>
<p>Java is much much quicker to compile than C++. You don&#8217;t have to
worry about dependencies the way you do in C++. A modern Java IDE
compiles as you type and can even run unit tests on the fly (though I
never quite got into this myself). Even better, once you&#8217;ve compiled
the code, it should run wherever you&#8217;ve got a suitable JVM. Java
abstracts the platform nicely enough.</p>
<p>The flip-side of this is that, if you need to dig beneath the JVM and poke at the system level, you&#8217;ll have to work harder. The JNI is fiddly to use and not documented to Java&#8217;s usual high standards. Of the low-level languages, C and C++ have the edge here; and high-level languages built on the C hardware abstraction layer such as Python and Perl fare better.</p>
<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
<p>With Java, if you&#8217;re doing something someone&#8217;s probably done
before, they probably have done it before and made a suitably licensed
library available. I was very impressed with the range and quality of
Java libraries. The fact that Java has a standard and widely followed
set of coding conventions makes it easy to work with these libraries, 
as does the Javadoc documentation system and the JUnit test framework.</p>
<h3 id="javadoc">Javadoc</h3>
<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/">Javadoc</a> may seem like an incidental detail. It&#8217;s not part of the core language and you don&#8217;t need to use it when writing Java. The truth is that Javadoc is a defacto standard &#8212; so much so that it&#8217;s cloned itself into <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a>, which does a similar job for C++. Not everyone likes the documentation template which Javadoc imposes but few would complain at the end result: a coherent, consistent, hyper-linked documentation suite, and simple tools which allow you to generate your own documentation in the same format.</p>
<h3 id="junit">JUnit</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>, like Javadoc, is a defacto standard &#8212; a simple and well-documented test framework with great tool support built around it. Again, it&#8217;s been cloned into other languages even when they don&#8217;t naturally support such a framework.</p>
<h3 id="java-versus-c">Java versus C++?</h3>
<p>Java versus C++ for <em>what</em> exactly? As a general purpose programming language for doing XML-y database-y user-interface-y internet-y things, Java has the edge. Then again, C# probably has the edge over Java in this same domain &#8212; it certainly should do since it&#8217;s had the opportunity to learn from Java&#8217;s mistakes, and it surely has enough brains and backing behind it. I don&#8217;t speak from experience: I&#8217;ve never used C# and I don&#8217;t see any pressing need to use it. In fact, I don&#8217;t see the need to use Java. I&#8217;m convinced that high-level languages such as Python knock the spots off Java and any Java clone in the application development domain.</p>
<p>As a general purpose programming language which needs to mix low-level platform access and high-performance algorithms, C++ is probably still where it&#8217;s at. If you&#8217;re prepared to invest the effort to learn it (which I wouldn&#8217;t recommend!) then I&#8217;d say C++ is a more expressive language than Java. I&#8217;d rather be able to overload operators than have to put all my functions in classes. Structs beat beans.</p>
<h3 id="the-jvm-platform">The JVM Platform</h3>
<p>Java welcomes high-level languages. Just put the Java &#8220;J&#8221; in front of Python, Ruby, &#8230; and you&#8217;ll find an implementation of your favourite language running on the JVM. Then there are the JVM natives such as Groovy and Scala and no doubt many others. Russel Winder <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2007/accu2007_sessions#C++%20has%20no%20useful%20purpose">comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What about Java? It survives as the assembly language for Groovy programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="language-wars">Language Wars</h3>
<p>Reading through all this, I realise I&#8217;ve not said anything radical or original. At the outset I declared myself &#8220;a C++ programmer brought up on C&#8221; &#8212; which is pretty much what I was doing when I first encountered Java (though my not-so-secret mission was to write code using high-level languages). The truth now is that I&#8217;m actually a Python programmer brought up on C/C++, and as such, anything which might have seemed radical or original about Java seems, well &#8230; ordinary and bland.</p>
<p>Certainly I&#8217;ve been cured of any prejudice about Java being a feeble language designed to stop feeble programmers from getting hurt. It&#8217;s the other way round; Java is a powerful language and it&#8217;s the C++ programmers who revel in <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=104707">pain</a>.</p>
<p>It took me about a year to get round to writing this note, a year in which I&#8217;ve barely touched Java. I haven&#8217;t missed it.</p>

<a href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cis.udel.edu/</a>~silber/470STUFF/article.pdf</p>

<p>Compares C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, Rexx, and Tcl along various metrics (load time, run time, memory consumption, programmer efficiency, etc.)  The significant findings are not that impressive for Java (or, in fairness, for Tcl).</p>

<p>Thanks for the link Ivan. I hadn't come across that article, but it's certainly interesting reading. I found myself wondering exactly what the programmers' instructions were.</p>

<p>Reading between the lines of the section on "Program Structure", it looks like Java's poor showing is down to Java programmers failing to use the built-in hashed containers -- preferring to use arrays or hand-code tree structures. (Incidentally, I note the author says that hash table implementations exist in C++ class libraries -- which they don't, at least not in the standard library, and they won't until C++09). The scripters naturally went for built in hashed containers giving efficient and compact programs. I think nobody actually went for the 10-ary tree, which would have counted as premature optimisation.</p>
