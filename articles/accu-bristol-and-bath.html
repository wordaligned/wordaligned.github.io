<p>Lightning talks. In a pub. Me first! I hadn&#8217;t actually practised but I knew what I wanted to say and had picked a subject so trivial I couldn&#8217;t possibly overrun.</p>
<p>Yes, it was time, at last, for the first <a href="https://twitter.com/accuBristol" title="Follow ACCU Bristol &amp; Bath on twitter">ACCU Bristol &amp; Bath</a> meeting, to be held in an upstairs room at the Cornubia. We&#8217;d reconnoitred the venue a few weeks earlier. Although the room was dingy and we couldn&#8217;t work out where to put a screen, and despite disturbance from the increasingly raucous CAMRA meeting next door, the location was ideal and the beer superb. I looked forward to returning.</p>
<p>Plans change. In an agile last minute switch the meeting relocated to the Marriot &#8212; which, coincidentally, had just been announced as the host of next year&#8217;s <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences" title="ACCU 2013 comes to Bristol!">ACCU conference</a>. I shuffled through revolving doors into the hotel&#8217;s vacant lobby rehearsing my talk in my head. Where was everyone? It took some backtracking and interrogation to locate the subterranean room but fortunately they hadn&#8217;t started without me.</p>
<p>Now <strong>this</strong> was a proper meeting room. Panelled walls, no windows. A blank TV screen; green apples; red glasses; bottled water.</p>
<p><img src="/images/apple-display-adapter.jpg" alt="I carry one with me at all times"/></p>
<p>Ewan welcomed me. &#8220;Have you got a macbook display adapter?&#8221;</p>
<p>No. I didn&#8217;t even have the slides to my own presentation &#8212; I&#8217;d emailed them ahead to be merged into a single deck.</p>
<p>The screen flicked to life. Nine talks, five minutes each. We&#8217;d be done in an hour. After a brief welcome my slides were on screen and I was off.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I ran out of time, laughing too long at my own lightning anecdote which framed a talk about ellipses, the triple-dots &#8230; which mean different things in different places in different programming languages. Next up was Dan Towner who walked us through the algorithm used by compilers for allocating registers. It&#8217;s a greedy colouring of a planar map, he said, wrapped in a bail-and-retry loop. Dan Tallis spoke about the single committer model which works so well on open source projects. Developers don&#8217;t have write access to the repository and must submit patches to the committer for review, a protocol which encourages incremental and considered changes to a codebase. <a href="http://curbralan.com">Kevlin Henney</a> needed just a single slide to clear up some misconceptions in exactly five minutes. Chris Simons didn&#8217;t need any slides to describe where designs come from. Pacing the floor and waving his fingers, he explained that <span id="excerpt0"/>computer systems are punchlines; design is a matter of figuring out the joke. Attack the solution space with ants! No ACCU meeting would be complete without a discourse on C++ test frameworks and Malcolm Noyes duly dazzled us developing a C++ mocking library before our very eyes. Jim Thomson compared before and after binaries to prove his source code rearrangements hadn&#8217;t caused any damage. Ewan Milne, who&#8217;d not only organised and chaired the meeting, also contributed a talk on (guess what?) planning, subtitled how agile can Kanban be (say it!)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jaggersoft.com">Jon Jagger</a> postponed his closing talk. Macs just work if you&#8217;ve got the right connectors. We hadn&#8217;t. The audience wanted more but that&#8217;s no bad thing. We regathered in the hotel bar to crunch apples and chew over the evening. The ACCU Bristol &amp; Bath launch had been a success! The price of a pint and anodyne surroundings discouraged lingering. We drank up and headed off towards trains, homes, and, for a select few, the <a href="http://www.travelswithbeer.com/2010/07/09/the-cornubia-bristol/" title="CAMRA members can get pints at a reduced prices depending on the strength of the ale">Cornubia</a>.</p>
