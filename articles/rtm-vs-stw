<h3>Virtual hosting problems</h3>
<p>A colleague, call him Lem E Tweakit, was suffering from code-rage. I could tell from the way he was shoving his mouse around, hammering the keyboard and muttering. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything I can help with?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, maybe. Have you ever set up <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> on Windows?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I have, but never to do more than serve static files, run CGI scripts, that sort of thing. Given the choice, I&#8217;ll use a Unix-based system for a web server every time, and I prefer <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>, but anyway, what&#8217;s the problem?
</p>
<p>Virtual hosts weren&#8217;t working, Lem said. He&#8217;d googled around, found some instructions written up by someone who&#8217;d overcome a similar problem, followed the instructions, found they didn&#8217;t work, googled a bit more, found some slightly different instructions, they didn&#8217;t work either &#8230; and now he was stuck in a cycle of tweaking <code>httpd.conf</code>, restarting the web server, refreshing his browser to see if it had worked, googling. 
</p>
<p>Like he said, virtual hosts weren&#8217;t working! Were they even <em>supposed</em> to work on Windows?

<h3>Search the Web</h3>
<p>In a recent <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=208868">post</a> on his artima weblog Andy Dent suggests that when interviewing programmers, you should test their ability to search the web. He adds you should consider training existing employees in this skill.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got mixed feelings about this. Certainly you shouldn&#8217;t expect candidates to carry everything around in their heads (though I <em>would</em> expect someone who puts &#8220;Experienced C Programmer&#8221; on a CV to be able to write syntactically correct C without access to a reference &#8212; it&#8217;s alarming how many can&#8217;t!)
</p>

<h3>Read the Manual</h3>
<p>What I consider important is how exactly someone goes about finding information. The web search is a great tool but it shouldn&#8217;t always be the first one we reach for. Continuing our earlier example, for C the most important reference has to be K &amp; R, and I&#8217;d expect any serious C programmer to know and use this book. And Unix programmers call on <code>man</code> and <code>info</code> even if the search quality for these references isn&#8217;t quite up to google&#8217;s standards.
</p>
<p>C and Unix are showing their age, though. What about something more up to date, something more closely aligned to the internet? Python, say, to pick something I claim to know about.
</p>
<p>Again, if I need Python help I don&#8217;t start with a web search, even though a lot of the time I do end up referring to web pages. For simple queries I try <code>help()</code> in an interpreted session. For full answers, I point my web browser at the official documentation, which, incidentally, I have bookmarked to use a location on my hard-disk &#8212; a location which came as part of my standard Python installation. This means I have direct access to the documents on- or off-line, it&#8217;s fractionally quicker than going to <a href="http://docs.python.org">docs.python.org</a>, and I&#8217;m guaranteed to get the documentation for the Python version I&#8217;m using. If I <em>still</em> can&#8217;t find what I&#8217;m looking for then there are a number of options: the Python Cookbook, a web search, email a friend, comp.lang.python.
</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a non-standard Python library I&#8217;m using (the Python Imaging Library for example) then again I&#8217;ll try the official documentation for that library first; and if this documentation doesn&#8217;t help then I probably won&#8217;t be using the library much longer (the PIL documentation is fine, I use it all the time).
</p>

<h3>No, Search the Web</h3>
<p>I won&#8217;t pretend I always read the manual and never search the web. Far from it. On many occasions a web search turns up something that&#8217;s better than the official manual. <span id="excerpt0"/>On other occasions I want a quick fix: perhaps I&#8217;m using a technology I really don&#8217;t care much about, and am therefore reluctant to invest any great effort in. Vi for example, some Java framework, or Open Office.
</p>
<p>Does <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache httpd</a> fall into this category? Of course not. It may not be my <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">web server of choice</a>, but it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s web server of choice, and definitely something a programmer should know about.
</p>

<h3>Apache Virtual Hosts</h3>
<p>I watched Lem more closely. The first thing I noticed was that when he restarted Apache &#8212; by clicking an icon &#8212; a console window transiently appeared, and I&#8217;m pretty sure there was an error message in that window. What was it trying to say?
</p>
<p>Lem pulled up the server error log. Sure enough, it recorded an error found in the configuration file. Not a fatal error, otherwise the server wouldn&#8217;t have started, but a strong indication something wasn&#8217;t right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I&#8217;ve tried googling for that, but &#8230;&#8221;
</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also noticed an icon linking to the online Apache documentation: look, there, right next to the &#8220;Start Apache&#8221; icon! 
</p>
<p>We clicked it and found ourselves on the Apache HTTP Server <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/">documentation</a> page. 
</p>
<img src="/files/apache-22-docs.jpeg" alt="Apache 2.2 documentation page"/>

<p>As you can see, there&#8217;s a prominent search widget at the top of the page. Lem instinctively typed &#8220;Virtual Hosts&#8221; into the text field and clicked the button.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a google search,&#8221; he said, disgusted. Hadn&#8217;t Google been letting him down all morning?
</p>
<p>Not quite! It&#8217;s actually a google <em>site</em> search &#8212; you do know google can return you search results within a specific site? As it happened, the first hit from this search was the one we wanted, one we should have spotted on the front page of the documentation if we&#8217;d not been diverted by the search button.
</p>
<p>After about 5 minutes of careful reading we&#8217;d fixed <code>httpd.conf</code>, eliminated the warning, and virtual hosting was working.
