<p>I recently <a href="/articles/high-altitude-programming.html">noted</a> that the confined environment of an aeroplane
or train seat was a surprisingly good place to get some thinking
done. In this article, I want to describe a radically different &#8212; but
even more effective &#8212; workplace.</p>
<p><span id="continue-reading"/></p>
<p>The workplace I&#8217;m talking about provides an exciting and stimulating
environment. When you enter you&#8217;re immediately struck by the lack of
formal structure.  The indoor area is open-plan, with no internal
doors or dividers.  Desks group into clusters and separate projects
centre on each cluster. During each day a team member switches
projects several times. The workplace extends outdoors too and everyone
spends a quarter of each day working outside on more physical and messy
activities.</p>
<p>Bright colours appear everywhere and at all levels; pictures fill the
walls and paints sit on the tables. Letters and numbers hang from
clothes lines strung across the room. There are things to manipulate,
hard and soft, rough and smooth, quick and dead. The team leader uses
music, speech and movement to convey instructions. Most activities have
a physical element.</p>
<p>Some elements are more structured. Members work fixed hours, arriving
at and leaving the workplace at the same time every day; and indeed
every working day starts the same way with a short team meeting, which
typically includes song, movement, and a discussion of the goals for
that day; and each day concludes with a similar meeting, which recaps
on the day&#8217;s progress and looks forward to tomorrow. Breaks, which are
mandatory, occur at set times, and members also eat together. There is,
though, considerable freedom within this rigid structure: <span id="excerpt0"/>a 50% rule
applies &ndash; each member spends half the time working on fixed projects
and the other half working on self-directed projects.</p>
<p>The library is well-stocked and comfortable, with soft cushions to
recline on. There is a quiet area if members need to nap.</p>
<p>The workplace welcomes customers, who often visit, and who receive a
brief written progress report each week. Industry standards are
prominently displayed. Members set their own targets and the team
leader reviews progress towards these targets, relaying results back
to customers.</p>

<p>Good thinking Jez. I realise <a href="http://www.jezuk.co.uk/cgi-bin/view/jez/atticCam" rel="nofollow">attics</a> are popular with writers, but perhaps you do need to get out more :-)</p>

<p>Very simple.. the ultimate work environment is: using VPN, and working from home :} Wearing boxers, window open, and blasting music. Doesn't get much better than that.</p>
