<p>In a recent <a href="http://herbsutter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2D4327CC297151BB!295.entry">blog post</a> Herb Sutter improves some code which originally appeared in an online C++ magazine. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s an example I saw again yesterday in a recent peer-reviewed online magazine article showing how to write some C++ code to solve a particular problem. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the code I&#8217;m going to show; but it tries to use a technique to &#8220;save typing&#8221; while accomplishing the opposite because of being unaware of a clever little C++ feature.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll rearrange the particular code I saw to disguise the example (lots of people do this, and it would be unfair to target one person). 
</p>
</blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t want to discuss the technical content of Sutter&#8217;s post (which is as insightful as ever). It&#8217;s the surrounding context which interests me. 
</p>
<span id="continue-reading"/>


<h3>A peer-reviewed magazine</h3>
<p>The magazine he mentions is <strong>peer-reviewed</strong>. Is Sutter claiming superiority over the peer-reviewers? I don&#8217;t think so. I suspect the magazine he refers to is <a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource">The C++ Source</a>, where the peer-review team reads like a C++ who&#8217;s who.
</p>
<p>Were the reviewers lax on this occasion? I doubt it. I&#8217;ve been through The C++ Source review process myself, a journey which has ended in both acceptance and rejection, and can confirm the reviewers are thorough and stringent.
</p>
<p>Or was it just a point on which the reviewers agreed to differ? Could be. But I&#8217;d say Sutter&#8217;s code improves the original substantially, and find it hard to believe the author wouldn&#8217;t make the suggested changes if offered them &#8212; unless he or she was paid by the templated parameter, that is.
</p>
<p>The mystery is compounded when you see that Sutter himself is on The C++ Source review team. Well, I guess he must be a recent addition, otherwise he&#8217;d surely have offered his correction before the article was published. Still, you do see his name right up there on the magazine&#8217;s home-page.

<h3>Writing to learn</h3>
<p>I think Sutter is mistaken to disguise the article and its author on the grounds of fairness. <span id="excerpt0"/>I&#8217;m not suggesting authors are thick-skinned or deserve rough treatment, but I think anyone who writes technical material learns about that material at the same time &ndash; yes, really, that&#8217;s one of the main benefits of writing. And however expert the reviewers, that learning process doesn&#8217;t stop once the article is published. The peerless Donald Knuth still writes out hexadecimal dollar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">cheques</a> to anyone who finds an error in his work.
</p>
<p>It would be more helpful to both the author and readers of the original article if Sutter had offered his suggestions directly as a comment on the article&#8217;s discussion forum &#8212; linking to his own website if necessary. Alternatively, he could have contacted the author privately and the article could have been revised. Web publishing makes this easy.
</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m reading too much into a blog post! As I&#8217;ve said before, I have enormous respect for Herb Sutter and all he&#8217;s done for C++.
</p>

<h3>Shell script slips</h3>
<p>On a more personal note, I wrote an <a href="/articles/shell-script-sets.html">article</a> for another peer-reviewed magazine, <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/overloadonline">Overload</a>, promoting shell scripting. As usual the reviewers did a great job, but since its publication a couple of readers&#8217; comments have caused me to go back and revise it. It&#8217;s not about covering up my mistakes &#8212; as in the case described by Sutter, the original version worked well enough &#8212; it&#8217;s about making things as good as I can. Thanks to a couple of expert readers who took the trouble to offer direct feedback, I learned something, which now future readers can also benefit from.
</p>

<p>As an even more personal aside, I want to apologise to anyone who&#8217;s had trouble either accessing this blog or commenting on it (apart from spammers, that is). I&#8217;m banging into resource limits on the shared server which hosts this site, and my fast CGI processes are being culled. I&#8217;m working out how to sort things out.
</p>
<p>Unfunnily enough, I tried commenting directly on Herb Sutter&#8217;s blog. After signing in to Windows Live and entering my comment I got a &#8220;server error&#8221; message. I tried again, then tried using another session in a different web-browser. No luck. I then clicked the &#8220;Send a Message&#8221; button, entered my screen name, and was then presented with an email form to fill in. Above the form was a warning message:
</p>
<blockquote><p>You can&#8217;t send or reply to this person because of their communication preference settings.
