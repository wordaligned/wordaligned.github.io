<p>A comment on this <a href="http://blog.wordaligned.org">blog</a> by David P
Thomas got me thinking about testing released software. Traditionally,
software developers concentrate on testing software back in the lab,
arguing that once it&#8217;s released into the big wide world it&#8217;s a little
bit late to start finding problems. In this article, I beg to differ.</p>
<p><span id="continue-reading"/></p>
<h3 id="c-assertions">C++ Assertions</h3>
<p>A classic example would be the use of <code>assert</code> in C++. The standard
<code>assert</code> is a macro which the preprocessor expands in different ways
depending on whether the code is compiled in &#8220;release&#8221; or &#8220;debug&#8221;
mode. In debug mode an assertion which fails causes the program to
abort. In release mode (i.e. when the compiler flag -DNDEBUG is set),
the assertion is simply eliminated by the preprocessor and can
therefore have no effect.</p>
<p>What use is this evanescent <code>assert</code> to the end user of our release?
None whatsoever. What use is it to the software developer once the
code has been compiled into a releasable binary? None whatsoever.</p>
<p><span id="excerpt0"/>The whole business of maintaining two versions of the software (one
for use by developers, another for users) is problematic, and
especially so in the case of assertions. Let&#8217;s say, for example, the
assertion checks an array index is in range before we write to that
array. During development the assertion never fires &#8212; and we may
convince ourselves there&#8217;s no logical way it can fire and that
therefore the check can safely be removed for production
<a href="#footnote"><a href="http://powertwenty.com/kpd/blog/index.php/python/test_driven_development_in_python">1</a></a>.  Under extreme circumstances things may not be quite
so definite. If a resource runs out, if something gets corrupted, if
an aberrant set of inputs causes an untested and unforeseen code path
to be exercised; if any of these things happens then it may well be
that the assertion <em>would</em> fire, causing the program to abort before
any further damage could be done to the user&#8217;s data or indeed itself.</p>
<p>Such extreme behaviour is far from ideal for the end user and you
could argue our test regime failed us. Nonetheless, it seems silly
to strip such potentially helpful code before we ship. If the product
does fail in this way and ends up being returned at least we should
have diagnostic information about where things went wrong.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an interesting
<a href="http://www.quantum-leaps.com/writings/samek0308.pdf">paper</a> in which
Miro Samek expands on this argument, likening assertions to fuses designed 
to protect the system.</p>
<h3 id="sanity-checks">Sanity Checks</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s suppose our product is a server-based piece of software. We
assemble this server ourselves and during assembly we run a series of
sanity checks to confirm that the hardware functions correctly. Once
we&#8217;re satisfied everything is in working order, we remove all traces
of these experiments, finish the installation, and ship the server.</p>
<p>Surely it would be better to leave the tests in place so they can be
run when the server is unpacked at the other end of its journey? There
may have been some damage in transit. There may well be damage at some
later point when the unit is moved to a new server room. In either
case, we can add value by including the test code with no extra cost to ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="regression-tests">Regression Tests</h3>
<p>Similarly, if our product is a desktop application, we probably have a
set of system tests we run it through regularly to check there
hasn&#8217;t been a regression somewhere. Why not include these tests as
part of the standard product installation? It might help diagnose a
problem if the product is installed on a platform which differs in
some crucial way to the ones we used during development.</p>
<h3 id="unit-tests">Unit Tests</h3>
<p>If our product is a library delivered either as source code, or perhaps
pre-compiled library, we need to also ship documentation showing how to use this
code. One part of this documentation should be in the form of test code;
typically a straightforward set of recipes demonstrating the correct use of the
library. As well as documenting normal use, the tests will also stress the
library and confirm it handles boundary conditions and malformed inputs. With a
little extra effort, we can supply a wrapper program which runs through all
these tests and summarises their results.</p>
<p>In this particular case, the benefits are obvious: the library and
tests combine into a single package which serves both the original
developers and the happy new owners equally well.</p>
<p>This is hardly an original idea but perhaps it&#8217;s one which the
open source movement has helped promote. As an example: if I&#8217;m trying to figure
out how to use a particular Python library, one of the first places I
look is in the <a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/tags/r25/Lib/test/">test directory</a>.
<a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/tags/r25/Lib/test/test_socket.py?rev=51918&amp;view=markup">Here</a>,
for example, are the tests for the <code>socket</code> module.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, I suspect my Python installation is broken, I can
test it as follows:</p>
<div class="typocode">

<pre class="prettyprint">$ python Lib/test/regrtest.py 

</pre>

<p><a id="footnote"><a href="http://powertwenty.com/kpd/blog/index.php/python/test_driven_development_in_python">1</a></a>
(Note, though, that we shy from removing the assertion itself from the
code, arguing that &#8220;it helps document preconditions&#8221;, or &#8220;you never know if
something in the calling code might change&#8221;.)</p>
