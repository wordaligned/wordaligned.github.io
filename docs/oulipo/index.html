  <p>Computer programmers and OuLiPians write constrained texts. This talk follows the links.

<p>As software developers, we often ponder what it is we do: are we architects, engineers, or scientists? Are we &ndash; even &ndash; rock stars or ninjas? Which metaphors best fit? Tending a code base is like gardening. Through the seasons we encourage new growth, whilst pruning back dead code and squashing bugs. Programming is like carpentry, maybe. We wield a set of tools, kept sharp and ready for action. Programming is like cooking. Source the finest ingredients and follow the recipe.

<p>I think there's a more obvious metaphor. Actually there's nothing meta- about it. It is what we do.

<p><big>We're writers.</big>

<p>We write to communicate and to instruct. We write for fun and profit. We edit and adapt. We rewrite. We borrow text from other writers. The languages we think we write in ... C++, Python, Javascript ... are actually just highly stylised dialects of our native tongue. Like poets we're particular about punctuation and space. We have strict (and strange) rules about spelling. The texts we write &ndash; programs &ndash; are subject to formal constraints.

<p>We're writers bound by mathematical rules.

<p>November, 1960. Paris. The poet Raymond Queneau organises the first Oulipo meeting. A dozen turn up: writers, mathematicians, surrealists. Their mission: to explore the literary potential of applying mathematical constraints to texts.

<p>Of course constrained writing is nothing new &ndash; consider the haiku: 17 syllables, arranged as 3 phrases of 5, 7 and 5 syllables (can you see the prime numbers?), a Japanese form many centuries old &ndash; and one strand of the Oulipo's efforts is devoted to researching past experiments and structures, but I claim it's no coincidence the Oulipo emerged at much the same time as our own novel form of constrained writing: computer programming.

<p>In this talk I'll discuss the Oulipo in more depth, investigating the parallels between their work and ours. We'll focus on Georges Perec, whose book Life A User's Manual is an OuLipian tour de force. There will be some code, not much, as well as algorithms, tweets, poems, easter eggs and &ndash; as you'd expect &ndash; bugs.

The chap in the polka dot jeresy who isn't me is Richard Beard, a writer who I met on a creative writing course in 1997. This photo was taken a few years later when we went on a cycling trip in the Vosges mountains. I should apologise for the outfits: I now realise you're not supposed to wear that jersey unless you've led the king of the mountains competition in the Tour de France, which neither of us have.

  <h4>Richard Beard, 1996</h4>
  <img src="./files/x20.png" alt="X20 cover" />
  <blockquote>
  {365 &times; 20 &times; 10} + {2 &times; 20} (leap years). Equals exactly 73,040. Plus
  17 irregulars. Not give or take, not approximately, but exactly
  seventy-three thousand and fifty-seven. All the same, it&#8217;s difficult
  to prove.
  </blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Anyway, on the writing course he was working on a first draft of this book, X20. As you can see from the cover, it's about smoking. Actually, it's about not smoking, because the main character, Gregory Simpson, is trying to give up. There are 20 cigarettes in a packet and there are 20 chapters in the book. The first chapter comprises 20 short sections. I've put the entire text of one such section on a slide.

<p>The book is structured around a packet of cigarettes much as Gregory's life has been shaped by his addiction 

<p>Notice the language. Only one sentence in this section is a proper sentence. So Richard makes and breaks rules.

<blockquote><p style="text-align:left;">[&hellip;] Perec&#8217;s palindrome barely made sense to the readers. Some teachers took it for the work of an incompetent student, while
others suspected that they had been treated to a surrealist text produced by
&ldquo;automatic writing&rdquo;. Those with psychiatric interests identified the
author as an adolescent in a dangerously paranoid state; those who had not
forgotten the swinging sixties wondered whether it was LSD or marijuana that had
generated the disconnected images of the text. Readers seem to project their own
positive and negative fantasies onto Perec&#8217;s palindrome, as they do onto
other difficult, obscure and unattributed works.</blockquote>

  <h2>La Disparition</h2>
<h3>1969</h3>
  <p>This book avoids using a particular symbol. How crazy is
  that? Author GP must adapt sounds
  and jump through hoops to finish this book. Such a constraint
  constructs an unusual story about a group of humans looking
  for a missing companion, Anton Vowl. I could try and go on ...

<p>Notice the limitations on language. No Perec, mere, pere (though the more childish maman, papa are allowed). Readable. Overcame a very mild bout of writer's block! You think you're blocked: try and write 90000 words without using an E.

    <h2>Knight&#8217;s Tour</h2>
    <p>On an <strong>8 √ó 8</strong> board, there are <strong>26,534,728,821,064</strong> directed closed tours.
<aside class="notes">
<p>Apparently recreational. Actually, fundamental.
<p>Finding a knight's tour is a special case of the NP-hard problem of finding a Hamiltonian path on a generic graph and because it can be easily solved, its study provides a method of understanding the more general problem.
<p>The semi-regularity of the knight move is what makes it so interesting. The continual stagger across the board. It's trivial to finish a game of chess if you have two rooks - or a queen. With two bishops, it's impossible. But to trap a lone king with just two knights requires finesse.

Euler showed there's no square of order 6. He found a procedure to generate one of any odd order, or any order which is a multiple of 4. He conjectured no square existed for order 10, 14, 18 ... (the odd evens).

<h2>Easter Egg</h2>
<blockquote>The woman carries in her right hand a bulky set of keys,
  no doubt the keys of all the flats she has visited that day; some
  are fixed to novelty key rings: a miniature bottle of Marie Brizard
  <em>ap&eacute;ritif</em>, a golf tee and a wasp, a
  <strong>double-six domino</strong>, and a plastic octagonal token in
  which is set a tuberose flower.</blockquote>

  <h2>On the Nature of Things</h2>
  <h3>Lucretius, 99-55 BC</h3>
  <blockquote>
When atoms move straight down through the void by their own weight, they deflect
a bit in space at a quite uncertain time and in uncertain places, just enough
that you could say that their motion has changed. But if they were not in the
habit of swerving, they would all fall straight down through the depths of the
void, like drops of rain, and no collision would occur, nor would any blow be
produced among the atoms. In that case, nature would never have produced
anything.
