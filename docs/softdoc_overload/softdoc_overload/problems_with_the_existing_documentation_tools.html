<p>
The existing toolchain was, as already mentioned, based on a Microsoft
Word master document. Producing hard copy was as simple as CTRL+P,
followed by a dialog about printer settings and some manual labour
involving a ring binder. It's fair to say that the printed output
looked pretty much exactly as previewed: the author had good control
over pagination, positioning of images, fonts, colours and so on.</p>
<p>
The linked online pages took more effort. We'd got a license for a
tool which I'll call Word Doctor (not its real name&#8212;I'm using an
alias because I'm going to moan about it). Generating the linked web
pages using Word Doctor involved the following steps:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
Create a new Project.
</li>
<li>
Point it at the Microsoft Word Master.
</li>
<li>
Select some project options from the Word Doctor GUI.
</li>
<li>
Click the build button (experts, hit <span class="emphasis"><em>F5</em></span>).
</li>
<li>
Make a cup of tea while the pages generate.
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>
All fairly easy&#8212;in theory. In practice, there were some other steps
which the Word Doctor user manual neglected to mention:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
Exit Microsoft Word. Word Doctor has trouble accessing the
  document otherwise.
</li>
<li>
Restart your PC. For some reason a resource got terminally locked up.
</li>
<li>
Rewrite the Microsoft Word master using the Word Doctor document
  template.
</li>
<li>
Don't forget to exit Microsoft Word!
</li>
<li>
Create a new project etc.
</li>
<li>
Click the build button.
</li>
<li>
Click away a few warnings about saving TEMPLATE.DOT and OLE
  something or other.
</li>
<li>
Read the Word Doctor workarounds Wiki page on the intranet.
</li>
<li>
Click the build button again.
</li>
<li>
Go for lunch. Documentation builds took around half an hour.
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>
I am not exaggerating. The engineering manager admitted that he
estimated it took at least two days of struggling to convert a
Microsoft Word master into the online form. And nor do I blame Word
Doctor. I don't think Microsoft Word comes with a decent developer
API. Instead, it tries to do everything itself: from revision control,
through styling, to HTML output. It uses an opaque binary file format
to deter anyone from trying to develop tools to work with it.</p>
<p>
The final irritation was with the Word Doctor output&#8212;if you ever got
any. The HTML was packed with Internet Explorer specific Javascript,
and looked poor in any other browser.</p>

<p>
The real downside of Word Doctor was when it came to trying to connect
the Product to the Word Doctor web pages. This job fell to me. It was
a multi-layered integration task:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
on a team level I would work with the technical author to ensure the
  documentation content was correct, and contained the required Help
  topics.
</li>
<li>
on the Product side, the web-based user interface would call for
  help using a text identifier. The Help subsystem would use the
  identifier to look up an HTML location&#8212;a page and an anchor within 
  that page&#8212;and it could then pop up a new window viewing this 
  location.
</li>
<li>
on the documentation side, I would have to configure Word Doctor to
  ensure its HTML output included the right locations.
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
Unfortunately, there were problems with each of these layers.</p>
<p>
Personally, I got on well with the technical author, but the
documentation tools made it extremely hard for us to work on the same
file. We had to take it in turns or work with copies. I couldn't even
fix a typo directly.</p>
<p>
The Word Doctor output was a frame-based collection of static HTML
pages. Now, externally referencing a particular location in such a set
of pages is tricky&#8212;due to the limitations of frames&#8212;so the
Product's help sub-system had to dynamically generate a framed front
page displaying the appropriate left and right pane each time it was
called. Not too difficult, but more complex than strictly necessary.</p>
<p>
Both pages and anchors were a moving target in the Word Doctor
output. Every time you added a new section to the document you broke
most of the help references. Thus we found ourselves in a situation
where the technical author wanted the Product to stabilise in order to
document it and I needed the documentation to stabilise in order to
link to it.</p>

<p>
Microsoft Word uses a proprietary binary format. This ties you into
their product to a degree&#8212;effectively, you're relying on Microsoft
to look after your data because you simply cannot work with this data
without their tool. Of course, the risk of Microsoft collapsing during
the lifetime of your document may be one you can live with, but you
are also vulnerable to them ceasing to support the version of Word you
prefer, or charging an unreasonable amoount for an upgrade. It also
means:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
it's extremely hard for more than one person to work on a document
  at a time since changes to binary files cannot be merged together
  easily.
</li>
<li>
revision control becomes more expensive and less useful (how do you
  view the differences between two versions of the manual?)
</li>
<li>
it is very difficult to automate anything. As a trivial example,
  Word Doctor had no batch interface&#8212;it required human input at
  every stage. Now consider trying to rebadge the manual, perhaps for
  redistribution of the Product by some partner company. With a decent
  documentation toolchain this should be as simple as the build 
  <code class="code"><span class="identifier">prepare</span></code> target copying the correct logo graphic into place and
  applying a simple transformation to some text strings.
</li>
</ul></div>

<p>
Despite all of these limitations and irritations it was hard to convince
anyone a change was necessary or even desirable. The reasons were as much
organisational as technical.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
The existing tools had been used to produce acceptable end user
  documentation in the past for other products shipped by the company.
</li>
<li>
Already, considerable effort had been put into the Word master for
  the new Product (even if much of it would have to be scrapped due to
  the inevitable changes as the Product developed).
</li>
<li>
The engineering team had more work than it could cope with
  already. At least the user documentation could be outsourced to a
  contract technical author.
</li>
<li>
Setting up a smarter toolchain would need engineering input, and,
  once the tools were in place, would the technical author be able to
  use them productively?
</li>
<li>
The sales team saw the documentation task as non-urgent for much the
  same reason that they saw user input validation as a nice-to-have
  rather than a priority. After all, they'd run some promising beta
  trials at customer sites using a poorly documented and
  inputs-unchecked version of the Product. They were happy to continue
  to provide support and tuition as required, either on site, by phone
  or by email.
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
I could (and did) argue against all of these points:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
Existing documentation was stand-alone: it did not have to integrate
  with what it documented.
</li>
<li>
Using the existing tools to connect the new Product with
  its documentation looked like being a continual sink of effort.
</li>
<li>
The engineering team probably spent as long telling the technical
  author what to write as they might have spent writing it themselves.
</li>
<li>
Surely the technical author would quickly master a new documentation
  tool?
</li>
<li>
In fact it was more often the engineers than the sales team who provided
  support, and frequently for problems which could have been avoided with
  better input checking and more solid documentation.
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
As software engineers we need to concentrate on the software. That
means listening to the sales team; but when it comes to software
quality, we know best. I believe the only shortcut is to prune back
the feature list and, increasingly, I regard it as wrong to view
software documentation as an add-on. Decent documentation is one of
the first things I look for when I evaluate a piece of software: the
website, the user interface, the README, the FAQ list, and of course
the source code itself (if available). Quite simply, I didn't want to
deliver a Product with poor documentation. I didn't think it would
save us time in the short or long term.</p>
