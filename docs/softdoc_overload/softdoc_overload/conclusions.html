<p>
The real benefits of the new documentation toolchain are becoming more
and more apparent.</p>
<p>
As a simple example, a single text file defines the Product's four
part version number. The build system processes this file to make sure
the correct version number appears where it's needed: in the user
interface, in the CD install script&#8212;and, of course, in the
documentation.</p>
<p>
Another example. If we get a support call which we think could have
been avoided had the documentation been better, then we fix the
documentation directly. Anyone with access to the revision control
system and a text editor can make the fix. The full printed and online
documentation will be regenerated when they next do a build, and will
automatically be included in the next release.</p>
<p>
And a final example. The Product I work on checks file-based digital
video: it can spot unpleasant compression artifacts, unwanted black
frames, audio glitches and so on. The range and depth of these checks
is perhaps the area which changes most frequently: when we add support
for a new video codec or container file format, for example. The
architecture we have in place means that these low level enhancements
disrupt the higher levels of the software only minimally: in fact, the
user interface for this part of the Product is dynamically generated
from a formal description of the supported checks. Adding a check at
this level is a simple matter of extending this formal description. We
also need to document the check: perhaps a reference to the codec
specification and a precise definition of the metrics used. With an
intelligent documentation toolchain the documentation can live
alongside the formal description and build time checks confirm the
help text links up properly.</p>
<p>
From an engineering point of view, documentation is properly
integrated into the Product. I finish with another quotation from
<a href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/index.html" target="_top">Stayton</a>:</p>

payoff will be an efficient, flexible, and inexpensive publishing
system that can grow with your needs.</p></blockquote></div>
