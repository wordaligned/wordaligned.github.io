We continued on, then, deferring work on the documentation until at
least we had frozen the user interface, still pinning our hopes on
Word Doctor. Then the technical author left. She'd landed a full-time
editing position on a magazine.</p>
<p>
Again, I volunteered to work on the documentation. By now the
engineering manager had succeeded in selling the idea of switching
documentation tools to higher management. It was still hard for him to
authorise me to actually write the documentation, though, since we had
just recruited a new technical support engineer, based in North
America. This engineer had nothing particular lined up for the next
couple of weeks. What better way for him to learn about the Product
than to write the user manual?</p>
<p>
As it turned out it various delayed hardware deliveries meant it took
him a couple of weeks to set up a server capable of actually running
the Product&#8212;and then he was booked up on site visits. He didn't get
to spend any time on documentation.</p>
<p>
Version 1.0 was due to be released in a week's time. We had four chices:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
Ship with the existing documentation&#8212;which was dangerously out of
  date.
</li>
<li>
Stub out the documentation entirely, so at least users wouldn't be
  misled by it.
</li>
<li>
Revise the Microsoft Word document, use Word Doctor to generate HTML,
  reconnect the HTML to the Product.
</li>
<li>
Rewrite the manual using <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a>.
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>
We ruled out the first choice even though it required the least
effort. The second seemed like an admission of defeat&#8212;could we
seriously consider releasing a formal version of the Product without
documentation? Noone present had any enthusiasm for the third choice.</p>
<p>
So, finally, with less than a week until code freeze, I got assigned
the task of finishing the documentation using the tools of my
choosing.</p>
