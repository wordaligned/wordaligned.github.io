<p>
This article has touched on metaprogramming in a few of its more common
guises. I hope I have persuaded you that metaprogramming is both ubiquitous
and useful, and certainly that it shouldn't be left to a select few.</p>
<p>
At one time, the aim of computer science seemed to be to come up with a
language whose concepts were pitched at such a high level that software
development would be simple. Simple enough that people could program machines
as easily as they could, say, <a href="refs.html#refs.stroustrup">send a text message</a>. 
Compilers would be intelligent and forgiving enough to translate wishes to machine code.</p>
<p>
This aim is far from being realised. We do have higher-level languages but
their grammars remain decidedly mechanical. Programs written in low-level
languages still perform the bulk of processing. Perhaps a more realistic aim
is for a framework where languages and programs are compatible, able to
communicate with humans and amongst themselves, on a single device or across a
network.</p>
<p>
In such a framework, metaprogramming is your friend.</p>
