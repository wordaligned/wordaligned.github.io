    <h1>AI~NLP~BIG DATA~BGN</h1>
    <h2>Life Changing Technology</h2>

    <p>I've been working for Clinithink for a couple of years now --
    and I've been coming here to SSDC for a similar length of time. I
    thought I should try and explain what we do at Clinithink, because
    it's interesting and worthwhile. I've had a number of jobs over
    the years: 3D modelling software used in CAD systems, virtual
    reality simulators, video codecs, middleware for digital
    televisions, tools for Playstation games developers. The companies
    I've worked for have been highly successful and the products I
    helped develop are out there being used, and I like to think these
    products are worthwhile -- though I will admit to starting to
    question my involvement with the games industry when my son became
    addicted to Call of Duty.</p>


    <p>With Clinithink, it's different, it's more important than TV or
    computer games. The software has the potential to radically
    improve healthcare. It can quite literally save lives. It can find
    patients for drugs trials. It can inform the design of the trial,
    improving the chances of the trial succeeding. It can assist in
    the diagnosis of rare diseases. It can assist financial
    controllers in confirming medical procedures have been billed
    correctly. To fully succeed it needs to be deployed and integrated
    more widely. It needs to be understood.</p>

    <p>That's why I am here today. To improve understanding. This
    will be a high-level talk, because I don't have long, but it will
    also be a low-level talk because that's what interests me, and
    that's where I personally contribute to Clinithink's software.</p>

    <p>What we do is use computers to process electronic medical
    records. The input to our system is the narrative data found in
    medical records -- this could be via integration with a healthcare
    IT system, or directly via a REST API.</p>

    <p>Clinicians are trained to observe, and to write down what they
    observe clearly and directly. It's part of their professional
    discipline, just as programmers use version control, for
    example. These medical observations are written in free text:
    paragraphs, sentences, descriptions -- stories. Our software uses
    natural language processing and search engine techniques to digest
    these unstructured stories and annotate them with a formal
    structure. The result is medical records which can be searched,
    categorised, aggregated -- records whose data is unlocked for
    further processing.</p>

      
    <h2>Architecture</h2>

    <p>The engine is written in C++. It's designed to be highly
    efficient. It's generally stable and mature. Although a number of
    people have worked on it over the years, it looks very much the
    work of one man, Pete Johnson, a medical doctor and a brilliant
    self-trained programmer.</p>

    <p>The engine exports a number of task specific APIs. These can be
    called by an application - we write ours in Python, though
    previous versions of the software used C#. End users access the
     applicaton via a web UI. Integration clients use a REST API.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Inputs</h2>

    <p>The engine is fed clinical narratives. Clinicians are trained
    to observe and to write down what they see, much as software
    developers are trained to use version control and follow coding
    standards. The value in medical records, then, lies in being able
    to interpret stories -- to convert them into a form which can be
    processed by a computer, or computers.</p>

    <h3>Snomed</h3>

    <p>As well as documents, the Engine needs an encyclopedia --
    imagine an enormous book which contains all things medical:
    clinical findings, symptoms, diagnoses, procedures, body
    structures, organisms and other etiologies, substances,
    pharmaceuticals, devices and specimens. Such an encyclopedia
    exists and is in continual development. It goes by the name of
    SNOMED</p>

    <p>I use the word encylopedia, but it's much more than
    that. Wikipedia characterises SNOMED as "a multilingual thesaurus with
    an ontological foundation". As well as the core concepts, there's a
    model of how concepts can be combined to make post-coordinated
    expressions. So you can encode something like "third degree burn of left
    index finger caused by hot water".</p>

    <h3>Resources</h3>

    <p>Additionally, the engine is fed rules for how to find headings,
    expand acronyms, and similar. We have a team of medical
    terminologists who maintain and develop these rules, essentially
    customising SNOMED to map it to what physicians really
    write. There's information on word frequencies and parts of
    speech.</p>

    <p>At its heart, then, the Engine is looking for phrases which map
    to SNOMED expressions. That's the structured form.</p>
