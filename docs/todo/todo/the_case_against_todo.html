<p>
This article has covered the use and abuse of <code class="code"><span class="identifier">TODO</span></code>. In some cases, it is
redundant; in others inadequate; in others misleading; and in yet others it
could more usefully be replaced by code. <code class="code"><span class="identifier">TODO</span></code> is sometimes a note written in
some personal shorthand, which, like many such notes, is in danger of becoming
meaningless to even its originator.</p>
<p>
I have no major problem with any of these uses, though personally I avoid
them. It's the times when <code class="code"><span class="identifier">TODO</span></code> (or <code class="code"><span class="identifier">FIXME</span></code> or <code class="code"><span class="identifier">HACK</span></code>) gets roped in to defer
the proper treatment of a defect which make it suspect.</p>
<p>
In Overload 68, Alan Griffiths writes:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The worst thing that can be done on encountering a problem is to
ignore it on the basis that "someone else" should deal with it. The
next worst thing is to bury it in a write-only "issues list" in the
hope that one day someone will deal with it. If everyone behaves like
that then nobody deals with anything.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>
Griffiths is talking about problems in a wider sense, perhaps, than this
article, but he expresses my frustration with <code class="code"><span class="identifier">TODO</span></code> perfectly. A search
through code for <code class="code"><span class="identifier">TODO</span></code>s is all too likely to reveal a "write only issues
list". Too often, <code class="code"><span class="identifier">FIXME</span></code> silently marks a place where we know something is
wrong, but we haven't bothered to do anything about it. Worst of all, <code class="code"><span class="identifier">HACK</span></code>
gets deployed when we know something is wrong and we fear we might have
made it worse.</p>
