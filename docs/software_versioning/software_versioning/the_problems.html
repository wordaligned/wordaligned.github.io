<p>
There are several problems with this procedure.</p>
<p>
I haven't explicitly stated how the builds are being created and how
they're being tested, but reading between the lines suggests that it's
a little ad hoc. It could well be that one of the developers generates
the builds from a personal working copy, runs a few sanity checks,
then throws the code across to the test team for a more thorough
thrashing.</p>
<p>
Such an approach exposes us to an unacceptable level of human
error. Instead, we need a machine to ensure that our builds are clean
and reproducible. Before worrying about how we version the software,
we must ensure we have a build server to automatically generate builds
for us, and to run as many tests as a machine can on these builds,
collating and publishing the results. Inevitably, there will still be
a need for manual testing; but this build server should become the
single source of builds for the manual testers.</p>
<p>
Even when this build server is in place and doing its job, the
procedure described suffers two major problems.</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
There is still too much manual intervention: somebody has to
remember to edit the VERSION file, and that somebody had better get
it right. Typically, as release dates close in, the pressure
increases, and editing fingers become less steady.
</li>
<li>
The final tagged build isn't the build which actually passed all
the manual tests. We rebuilt it! What's worse, we <span class="emphasis"><em>changed the code</em></span>
before rebuilding &#8212; we changed the VERSION file, and we checked the code
out of the repository in a different way.
</li>
