<p>
It may appear that some judicious use of keyword expansion will help
us automate the software version generation, but as we can see, it
does so at the expense of amplifying the second problem &#8212; which I
argue is the more serious.</p>
<p>
Let's revisit this second problem. We've created a chicken and egg
situation: we don't want to award the software its final version
number until we've tested it; but the version number is part of the
software, and we can't test the final version of the software until
we've set its version number. Which comes first?</p>
<p>
We may convince ourselves that we're making a fuss over nothing
important. How big a change is it to change the software version and
nothing else? A few text strings, perhaps; the contents of a dialog
box. Maybe it has an effect on the license sub-system. Oh, and the
documentation too.  Surely nothing much can go wrong with these simple
changes and a quick set of sanity checks should confirm they have been
correctly applied?  If we're really worried, we could always re-run
the full set of tests.</p>
<p>
These arguments don't convince me. When we get close to a release,
impatience and carelessness can set in. It would be foolish to think
the testers wouldn't baulk at repeating the full set of system tests
for no good reason. And it would be equally foolish to assume the
version change has had no side-effects.</p>
