<p>
Let's question the assumption that applying the version number
should be the <span class="emphasis"><em>last</em></span> step in the release procedure. Why is this?</p>
<p>
Essentially it's because we don't want to have more than one version
2.0. If a customer contacts us to report a problem with version 2.0 of
our software, then we'd better be able to identify exactly what it is
they're running. Indeed, if the system testers report a problem with
version 2.0 of the software, we'd equally like to know which build
they're talking about. If we fixed the software version at 2.0 and
then continued to work on the code until it reached release quality,
how would we ever identify the real version 2.0?</p>
<p>
Note, though, that if we were prepared to allow our build server to
generate a unique build number for every build it produces, and to use
this as our version number, we'd have no problems. If build 1729 was
the build which passed the tests, then our release could simply be
identified as version 1729 &#8212; with no change required. Unfortunately
version numbers aren't just numbers; conventions dictate how their
fields are interpreted, and a version of 1729 flouts these
conventions.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="software_versioning.the_best_of_both"></a>The Best of Both</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
The way to break out of this apparent conflict is simple.  We
must give up on the idea of tying the version number to the version
control system: it just doesn't work. Instead, we can adapt the build
number idea to automate our versioning as follows.</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
Again, a single file &#8212; VERSION, let's say &#8212; must provide the
single source of version information. This file is version controlled,
but doesn't use keyword expansion <sup>[<a name="id4758199" href="#ftn.id4758199">2</a>]</sup>. Instead, it will
(generally) only be modified automatically by the build system.
</li>
<li>
At the <span class="underline">start</span> of the countdown to release 2.0, the contents of this file read
2.0.0. Here, the leading "2.0" is the major and minor part of the
version number, and the trailing "0" is the build number.
</li>
<li>
From this point onwards, each time the build server produces a
build it uses up a build number. As a post-build step, the server
edits the VERSION file to increment the build number by 1, then checks
this change in, ensuring that no subsequent build can have the same
version number.
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>
We now have the build server generating a series of release
candidates, each with its very own version number, 2.0.0, 2.0.1,
2.0.2, ...  When a release candidate meets the required quality
level it can be promoted to being a formal release. This promotion is
essentially a book-keeping operation: the software may be tagged, the
deliverables may be archived; but whatever happens, there should be no
further change to the code, and what gets shipped will be <span class="emphasis"><em>identical</em></span>
to what was tested.</p>
<a name="the_best_of_both.refinements"></a><h3>
<a name="id4758256"></a>Refinements</h3>
<p>
You'll notice that the full version of the final 2.0 release is
unlikely to be 2.0.0. If it took us another 29 builds to fix all the
defects, we will ship 2.0.29 &#8212; a rather less attractive
number. Typically, in most cases, we should truncate the version
number before presenting it to the user. You certainly won't see a 
press release announcing the completion of version 2.0.29!</p>
<p>
Often, a three part version number is insufficient. It's more common
to choose a number of the form 2.2.3.67, interpreted as: major version
2, minor version 2, patch number 3, build number 67.</p>
<p>
There is a convention <sup>[<a name="id4758292" href="#ftn.id4758292">3</a>]</sup>
to use odd minor version numbers for ongoing development and even version 
numbers for released versions. Thus, while the release team are knocking
<code class="literal">2.0.x</code> into shape, the development team continue with <code class="literal">2.1.x</code> on the trunk.</p>
<p>
Scripts should be written to perform all the common operations: to
create release branches, to promote release candidates into full
releases, and so on. It's important to have these scripts, and indeed
the whole process, tested and in place well before the countdown to the final
release.</p>
