<p>
Let's question the assumption that applying the version number
should be the <span class="emphasis"><em>last</em></span> step in the release procedure. Why is this?</p>
<p>
Essentially it's because we don't want to have more than one version
2.0. If a customer contacts us to report a problem with version 2.0 of
our software, then we'd better be able to identify exactly what it is
they're running. Indeed, if the system testers report a problem with
version 2.0 of the software, we'd equally like to know which build
they're talking about. If we fixed the software version at 2.0 and
then continued to work on the code until it reached release quality,
how would we ever identify the real version 2.0?</p>
<p>
Note, though, that if we were prepared to allow our build server to
generate a unique build number for every build it produces, and to use
this as our version number, we'd have no problems. If build 1729 was
the build which passed the tests, then our release could simply be
identified as version 1729 &#8212; with no change required. Unfortunately
version numbers aren't just numbers; conventions dictate how their
fields are interpreted, and a version of 1729 flouts these
conventions.</p>
