<p>
First, let's consider a sensible but flawed recipe for creating a
versioned software release. To make the discussion easier to follow,
let's suppose it's version 2.0 we want to release. Let's also suppose
that a file named VERSION is the sole point of version information
for the software <sup>[<a name="id4754139" href="#ftn.id4754139">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
At some suitable point, branch the software to isolate the release
from noise on the main development trunk. Edit VERSION so its
contents read <code class="literal">2.0.0 RELEASE BRANCH</code> and check this change in.
</li>
<li>
Create a build from the release branch.
</li>
<li>
Test this build.
</li>
<li>
If the tests pass, edit VERSION so its contents read <code class="literal">2.0</code>, check
the change in, and go on to the next step. If the tests haven't
passed, we need to fix all the bugs we've found and return to step 2
(or even, in extreme circumstances, to step 1).
</li>
<li>
Tag the release branch. Checkout this tagged version of the code and
create our final release build from it.
</li>
</ol></div>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="software_versioning.issues"></a>Issues</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
There are several problems with this procedure.</p>
<p>
I haven't explicitly stated how the builds are being created and how
they're being tested, but reading between the lines suggests that it's
a little ad hoc. It could well be that one of the developers generates
the builds from a personal working copy, runs a few sanity checks,
then throws the code across to the test team for a more thorough
thrashing.</p>
<p>
Such an approach exposes us to an unacceptable level of human
error. Instead, we need a machine to ensure that our builds are clean
and reproducible. Before worrying about how we version the software,
we must ensure we have a build server to automatically generate builds
for us, and to run as many tests as a machine can on these builds,
collating and publishing the results. Inevitably, there will still be
a need for manual testing; but this build server should become the
single source of builds for the manual testers.</p>
<p>
Even when this build server is in place and doing its job, the
procedure described suffers two major problems.</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
There is still too much manual intervention: somebody has to
remember to edit the VERSION file, and that somebody had better get
it right. Typically, as release dates close in, the pressure
increases, and editing fingers become less steady.
</li>
<li>
The final tagged build isn't the build which actually passed all
the manual tests. We rebuilt it! What's worse, we <span class="emphasis"><em>changed the code</em></span>
before rebuilding &#8212; we changed the VERSION file, and we checked the code
out of the repository in a different way.
</li>
</ol></div>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="software_versioning.keyword_expansion"></a>Keyword Expansion</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
We might turn to our version control system to help us overcome the
manual intervention problem. Rather than edit a file by hand,
shouldn't the version control system provide the version number
directly?  This is a seductive argument but I'm going to suggest it's
wrong. Before explaining why I think it's wrong, let's show how you can
indeed derive a version number directly from the metadata stored in
the code repository.</p>
<p>
To provide a concrete example, assume we're using Subversion for
version control. A typical Subversion repository layout would be:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="literal">`-- trunk
  |   |-- file1
  |   `-- file2
  |-- branches
  |   |-- 1.0
  |   |   |-- file1
  |   |   `-- file2
  |   `-- 2.0
  |       |-- file1
  |       `-- file2
  `-- tags
      |-- 1.0
      |   |-- file1
      |   `-- file2
      `-- 2.0
          |-- file1
          `-- file2
</code></pre>
<p>
The trunk area is where most development goes on. When we want to
branch the code before making a release, we copy the trunk into the
branches area; and when we finally freeze the release, we tag it by
copying it into the tags area. To check out release 2.0 of the
software we'd issue the command:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="literal">svn checkout svn://svnserver/tags/2.0</code></pre>
<p>
As you can see, the repository URL embeds the desired version string,
2.0.  If we want to get the VERSION file to reflect the URL it was
checked out from, we must enable keyword expansion and set
its contents to read:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="literal">$URL: $</code></pre>
<p>
When we update this file on the trunk, the magic <code class="literal">$URL: $</code> keyword
expands to read something like:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="literal">$URL: svn://svnserver/trunk/VERSION $</code></pre>
<p>
When we copy this file to our 2.0 branch and update, we'll see:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="literal">$URL: svn://svnserver/branches/2.0/VERSION $</code></pre>
<p>
and in the tagged release area we get:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="literal">$URL: svn://svnserver/tags/2.0/VERSION $</code></pre>
<p>
With some simple text parsing we can extract this information. Here's
a minimal Python program which parses the repository URL it came from
in order to display version information.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
<code class="literal">
<span class="keyword">def</span><span class="identifier"> version</span><span class="special">():</span><span class="string">
    " Return the software version. "</span><span class="keyword">
    import</span><span class="identifier"> re</span><span class="identifier">
    match</span><span class="special"> =</span><span class="identifier"> re</span><span class="special">.</span><span class="identifier">search</span><span class="special">(</span><span class="string">"svn://svnserver/tags/([^/]*)"</span><span class="special">,</span><span class="string"> "$URL$"</span><span class="special">)</span><span class="keyword">
    return</span><span class="identifier"> match</span><span class="special">.</span><span class="identifier">group</span><span class="special">(</span><span class="number">1</span><span class="special">)</span><span class="keyword"> if</span><span class="identifier"> match</span><span class="keyword"> else</span><span class="string"> "Development"</span><span class="keyword">

print</span><span class="string"> "Version:"</span><span class="special">,</span><span class="identifier"> version</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
</pre>
<p>
If this program has been checked out from a base URL 
<code class="literal">svn://svnserver/tags/2.0</code>, running it yields the output:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="literal">Version: 2.0</code></pre>
<p>
Running it checked out from the trunk, we'll see:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="literal">Version: Development</code></pre>
<p>
Note, incidentally, that the CVS keyword designed for this purpose is
<code class="literal">"$Name$"</code> &#8212; this keyword won't even expand unless we checked out a
tagged version of the code.</p>
<a name="keyword_expansion.a_misuse_of_keyword_expansion"></a><h3>
<a name="id4758044"></a>A Misuse of Keyword Expansion</h3>
<p>
Look at what's happening here: we tag the software to ensure we can
recover exactly what went into a build; but by enabling keyword
expansion, the code we check out <span class="emphasis"><em>differs</em></span> depending on the repository
URL we use to access it. By tangling the software with version control
meta-data we're changing the very thing we want to stabilise.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="software_versioning.what_gets_tested_anyway_"></a>What gets tested anyway?</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
It may appear that some judicious use of keyword expansion will help
us automate the software version generation, but as we can see, it
does so at the expense of amplifying the second problem &#8212; which I
argue is the more serious.</p>
<p>
Let's revisit this second problem. We've created a chicken and egg
situation: we don't want to award the software its final version
number until we've tested it; but the version number is part of the
software, and we can't test the final version of the software until
we've set its version number. Which comes first?</p>
<p>
We may convince ourselves that we're making a fuss over nothing
important. How big a change is it to change the software version and
nothing else? A few text strings, perhaps; the contents of a dialog
box. Maybe it has an effect on the license sub-system. Oh, and the
documentation too.  Surely nothing much can go wrong with these simple
changes and a quick set of sanity checks should confirm they have been
correctly applied?  If we're really worried, we could always re-run
the full set of tests.</p>
<p>
These arguments don't convince me. When we get close to a release,
impatience and carelessness can set in. It would be foolish to think
the testers wouldn't baulk at repeating the full set of system tests
for no good reason. And it would be equally foolish to assume the
version change has had no side-effects.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.id4754139" href="#id4754139">1</a>] </sup>in other words, any part of the system which needs the
version number must derive it, either at build- or run- time, from this
single file. This typically includes the user interface, the
documentation, the licensing system. By enforcing a single point of
version information, we at least ensure consistency.</p></div>
