<p>
Even with the version numbers sorted out in the manner described, this
can be a painful way to develop software. In this article I've
described <span class="emphasis"><em>big bang</em></span> releases &#8212; perhaps a single major release is
made every year. In between these releases the main trunk of the
codebase is allowed to fall short of release quality: things
break and it's only when we create a release branch that we
undertake to fix them. There's too much dependency on a team of manual
testers to shake out problems, with the effect that the software
developers have neglected this duty.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the sales and marketing team are busily hyping the next
release. It's to be announced at an international trade show: How's
that for an immovable 
deadline <sup>[<a name="id4758362" href="#ftn.id4758362">4</a>]</sup>?</p>
<p>
Customers must be persuaded to upgrade but some fail to be excited by
the new 2.0 features, seeing instead a bunch of changes they don't
particularly want. Instead they'd like to continue with version 1.0,
which is the version they purchased &#8212; though naturally they demand
support and bug-fixes.</p>
<p>
Eventually the codebase spreads over several branches which have
become increasingly laden with patches merged in all
directions. The version control system can handle it but can the
developers? Although we have several active versions of the software,
it's moving irrevocably into maintenance mode.</p>
<p>
It seems to me that the emphasis on version numbers and features is
wrong, and may indeed take some of the blame for this grim
situation. It's <span class="emphasis"><em>wrong</em></span> to risk the stability of the main development
trunk and reserve branches for stable code. Instead we should aim for
a pristine trunk and use branches for work-in-progress and
experiments, so that at any point during development, the tip of the
trunk represents the best code we have.</p>
<p>
It's also wrong to create an environment in which customers cling to
old versions of software. Instead, we should consider upgrades from
the outset, and allow our software to migrate softly from version to
version.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.id4758362" href="#id4758362">4</a>] </sup>I recommend reading Paul Graham's essay
<a href="http://paulgraham.com/road.html" target="_top">The Other Road Ahead</a>, in which
he eloquently describes the advantages of
supplying a web-based software service. Here's what he has to say about
a typical desktop software release process.
<span class="emphasis"><em>"In the desktop software business, doing a release is a huge trauma,
in which the whole company sweats and strains to push out a single,
giant piece of code. Obvious comparisons suggest themselves, both to
the process and the resulting product."</em></span></p></div>
