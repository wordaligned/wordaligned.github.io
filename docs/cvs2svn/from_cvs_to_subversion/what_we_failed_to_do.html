A number of items on the evaluation and transition plan never
happened. We didn't create any local training materials&#8212;it didn't
seem necessary, given the high quality of <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>'s built in
documentation, and the fact that we all knew <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> (see Sidebar:
Subversion for CVS users). We ordered printed
copies of "Version Control with Subversion" and "Pragmatic Version
Control Using Subversion", set up an FAQ page on the Wiki that did
little more than collect together a few links to offsite URLs, and
left it at that.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Subversion for CVS users</b></p>
If you're familiar with <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> then <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> will also seem familiar.
This is hardly surprising since <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>'s stated aim is to be a
compelling replacement for <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a>. So, the terminology is almost
identical: you "check out" files from a "repository", you edit them,
you "diff" files to see what you&#8212;and others&#8212;have changed, and
you "check in" your changes. You "update" your working copy to merge
in changes made by other team members. You can "log" what changes have
been made. You can "branch" a project by copying it from the "trunk"
into a new place in the repository; similarly you can "tag" a fixed
version of a project by copying it into a new place in the
repository. You can "merge" changes made on the branch back to the
trunk, and vice versa.<br>

If you use the command line client, <code class="literal">svn</code>, the command line arguments
are often identical to the ones used with the <code class="literal">cvs</code> client (svn
commit, svn checkout, svn status, svn annotate svn diff, svn log,
etc.).<br>

The areas where <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> and <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> differ are generally where
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> fixes a <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> deficiency or where <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> actually manages
to simplify things. For example, as already mentioned, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>
fixes a well-known <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> deficiency by allowing you to move files and
directories; and <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>'s transactional model means that a version
number (a revision number, in <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> terminology) is an
incrementing integer applied to the repository as a whole, which is
easier to work with than the dot-separated version numbers which apply
to each <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> controlled file.<br>

More information for <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> users migrating to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> can be found
<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.2/svn.forcvs.html" target="_top">here</a>.

Despite encouragement, no-one had bothered to use the trial repository
as a sandbox for experimenting with <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> (apart from the
individual actually running the trial). So, the evaluation of the
product's usability and basic functionality was down to just one
person. Again, this turned out not to be a problem&#8212;and we weren't
really being lax when you consider how many open source projects have
switched, or are switching, to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>. We just <span class="underline">knew</span> <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>
worked.</p>
<p>
We quite deliberately didn't plan any reorganisation or pruning of the
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> repository before importing it: <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> would allow us to make
such changes in a better controlled way, once we got to the other
side. For similar reasons, we didn't change keyword expansion
properties on import. Again, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> allows you to manage such
properties better than <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> does, and now was not the time to start
arguing whether or not we really thought keyword expansion was a good
idea <sup>[<a name="id4754328" href="#ftn.id4754328">2</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>
We didn't fix any of our build scripts in advance. As part of the
evaluation we'd grepped the source for all such scripts and it
turned out you could count the number of scripted calls to <code class="literal">cvs</code> on
the fingers of one hand. We were confident we could fix these pretty
much as soon as our <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> server went live.</p>
<p>
We didn't even bother evaluating any advanced <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> clients. I
used the command line almost exclusively for experimentation: others
were happy to defer setting up <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_top">TortoiseSVN</a>, <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subclipse</a>, <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/psvn/psvn.el" target="_top">psvn</a>, etc., until
they actually had to.</p>
<p>
The one crucial item we neglected from our plan was to perform
acceptance tests on the freshly imported repository.  Fortunately we
discovered the problem with our carelessness almost immediately and
were able to recover swiftly.</p>
