<p class="title"><b>Atomic Commits</b></p>
Suppose a single logical change to the codebase&#8212;a bugfix perhaps&#8212;
requires six files to be changed. The programmer makes the change and
commits the new versions of the files to the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> repository. Although
a single commit command is executed, as far as <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> is concerned six
changes have been made, and each individual file moves to its own new
revision.  If another programmer wishes to patch the bugfix to another
code branch, all six files will need to be patched&#8212;but it's tricky
to find this out from <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a>. Information has been lost.
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> solves this problem with a simplified change model: version
numbers apply to the repository as a whole, and each change is a
transaction resulting in a new repository version which logically
corresponds to a whole new file tree.

<p>
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> is an excellent source control system: fast, powerful and
flexible. We had no concerns regarding its reliability and some effort
had been put into integrating it into our automated build, test and
release system. What's more, everyone in the team knew how to use <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a>
and how to work around its wrinkles. We all had our favourite
clients. Why ever would we want to change?</p>
<p>
There were a number of reasons:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
The team had grown and so had the codebase. The <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> server no longer
  served high volumes of files as quickly as we'd have liked.
</li>
<li>
As the codebase grew, it had become apparent that some files were in
  the wrong places or had the wrong names. <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> supports versioning of
  files but not of file-systems, meaning that we couldn't fix these
  issues in a controlled way. <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> fixes this <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> limitation.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> does not support atomic commits&#8212;another feature
  built in to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> sets out to be a "compelling replacement for <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a>" and,
  after a quick skim through the documentation, it looked as though
  the transition would be painless.
