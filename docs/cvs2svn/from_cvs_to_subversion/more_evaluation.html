To our surprise and disappointment, the speed of clean checkouts (by
"clean" I mean checking out the entire codebase into a new directory,
rather than simply updating an existing working copy) was
underwhelming. <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> sets a hard act to follow here since one of its
strengths is its speed, but I simply couldn't imagine <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>
claiming to be a compelling replacement for <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> unless it was equally
fast. In fact, head-to-head, on the same platform, our tests showed
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a> to be measurably quicker for clean checkouts.</p>
<p>
What the trials did indicate was that disk access rather than network
bandwidth was the main source of pain. Every time it checks out a
file, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> replicates the base version of that file and its
properties <sup>[<a name="id4753897" href="#ftn.id4753897">1</a>]</sup> into a hidden .svn directory, so for every 100 files you
checkout, at least 500 files will be created on disk.</p>
<p>
This replication is quite deliberate and is based on the principle
that disk-space is cheaper than network bandwidth. <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> makes
full use of the cached file copies in your working area&#8212;so, for
example, common operations such as viewing your modifications to a
file, or reverting these modifications, do not require any interaction
with the server.</p>
<p>
What we found, then, on the performance side, was that the routine
management of a working copy was much quicker. Clean checkouts took
time, yes, but use of the <code class="literal">svn update</code> command keeps these to a
minimum. In fact, the only user who frequently performed clean
checkouts was our overnight automatic build.</p>
<p>
Everything else went very well. Clearly, the authors of <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a> had
done a great job in fixing the problems with <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a>, and they'd done so
-- at least from a user's perspective&#8212;by simplifying it.</p>

metadata associated with a file&#8212;such as whether it's executable,
for example.</p></div>
