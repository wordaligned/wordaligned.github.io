<p>
Software must adapt to survive. Features are added, bugs squashed;
maybe the UI gets a makeover, maybe configuration files are replaced
by a database. Customers do not usually get exposed to this state of
flux. Typically, they are shipped stable and tested versions of a
Product&#8212;though they may also expect to receive patches against these
versions, fixing critical bugs for example.</p>
<p>
Software developers depend on their version control system to manage
both the formal, released versions, the patches, and the ongoing
development version, and to maintain the connections between these
versions. Computers are good at isolating the differences between
versions of a source file and at copying these differences between the
different branches of a code-base. Thus, a programmer can (for
example) fix a bug once, and the version control system can then be
used to safely apply the fix wherever it's needed.</p>
<p>
In a large code base, the version control system can be configured to
allow a team of programmers to work on the same set of files&#8212;and
even on the same file.  The version control system can make sense of
concurrent modifications, and merge them accurately; and in the rare
situations it can't, it fails safely.</p>
<p>
These considerations apply equally to the user manual, whose
versions must map to versions of the software. By choosing suitable
documentation formats and adopting version control, authors can
realise the same benefits.</p>
<p>
In fact, the leading open source version control system, Subversion
[Reference: Subversion], explains the concept of branching a project
using the particular example of a document -- a handbook, in this
case. See:
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04.html#svn-ch-4-sect-1 for
more information.  Note also that the Subversion documentation is
written in <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a>.</p>
