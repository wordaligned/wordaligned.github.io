<p>
I should outline here the basics of the toolchain I had evaluated. It
was based on <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a>. A two sentence introduction to <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> can be
found on the front page of the <a href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">SourceForge <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> Project</a>.  I reproduce it here in full:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> is an XML vocabulary that lets you create documents in a
presentation-neutral form that captures the logical structure of your
content. Using free tools along with the <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XSL stylesheets, you
can publish your content as HTML pages and PDF files, and in many
other formats.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>
I would also like to highlight a couple of points from the preface to
Bob Stayton's <a href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/index.html" target="_top"><span class="emphasis"><em><a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XSL: The Complete Guide</em></span></a>&#8212;a reference which anyone
actually using <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> is sure to have bookmarked:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A major advantage of <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> is the availability of <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> tools
from many sources, not just from a single vendor of a proprietary file
format.  You can mix and match components for editing, typesetting,
version control, and HTML conversion.<br>
 ...  <br>
The other major
advantage of <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> is the set of free stylesheets that are available
for it... These stylesheets enable anyone to publish their <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a>
content in print and HTML. An active community of users and
contributors keeps up the development of the stylesheets and answers
questions.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>
So, the master document is written in XML conforming to the <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a>
DTD. This master provides the structure and content of our
document. Transforming the master into different output formats starts
with the <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XSL stylesheets.  Various aspects of the
transformation can be controlled by setting parameters to be applied
during this transformation (do we want a datestamp to appear in the
page footer?, should a list of Figures be included in the contents?),
or even by writing custom XSL templates (for the front page, perhaps).</p>
<p>
Depending on the exact output format there may still be work for us to
do.  For HTML pages, the XSL transformation produces nicely structured
HTML, but we probably want to adjust the CSS style sheet and perhaps
provide our own admonition and navigation graphics. For Windows HTML
Help, the <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XSL stylesheets again produce a special form of HTML
which we must then run through an HTML Help compiler.</p>
<p>
PDF output is rather more fiddly: The <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XSL stylesheets yield
XSL formatting objects (FO) from the <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XML master. A further
stage of processing is then required to convert these formatting
objects into PDF. I used the <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/" target="_top">Apache Formatting Objects Processor (FOP)</a>, which in turn depends on
other third-party libraries for image processing and so on.</p>
<p>
As we can see, there are choices to be made at all stages: which XSL
transform software do we use, which imaging libraries; do we go for a
stable release of Apache FOP or the development rewrite? Do we spend
money on a <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XML editor? Since we have full source access for
everything in the chain we might also choose to customise the tools if
they aren't working for us.</p>
<p>
These choices were, to start with, a distraction.  I wanted the most
direct route to generating decent documentation. I kept reminding
myself that content was more important than style (even though the
styling tools were more fun to play with).</p>
