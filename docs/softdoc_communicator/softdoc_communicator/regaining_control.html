My frustration with the existing documentation tools set me thinking
about alternatives. I looked first to the open source world, where
there's no shortage of excellent documentation and where the authors
are happy to show how they generated it.</p>
<p>
I experimented by downloading and attempting to build some open source
documentation. Once I had this basic step working, I continued to
experiment. Could I change fonts, include images, replicate the house
style? How easy were the tools to use with our own content?</p>
<p>
After a Friday afternoon's experimentation I had something worth
showing to the engineering manager: an end-to-end solution which, from
a <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XML master, generated a skeleton PDF and HTML user manual in
something approaching the house style.</p>
<p>
I suggested to the engineering manager that we should switch the
usermanual to be based on the tools I had just demonstrated. I said
I'd be happy set up the toolchain. He agreed with me that technically,
this seemed the way forwards. However, it wasn't easy for him to give
me the go ahead for the reasons already discussed.</p>
<p>
I confess I had my own doubts too. All I knew at this stage was that
<a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> could do the job and that I would happily tinker with it to
get it working for us. I didn't know if we could be productive using
it. At least we understood the limitations of the current tools.</p>
<p>
We both recognised that the single most important thing was
content. Full and accurate documentation supplied as a plain README
would be of more practical use to our customers than something
beautifully formatted and structured but misleadingly inaccurate.</p>
<p>
In the end we deferred making a final decision on what to do with the
manual.  The results of my experiment did seem worth recording, so I
spent a day or so tidying up and checking in the code so we could
return to it, if required.</p>
