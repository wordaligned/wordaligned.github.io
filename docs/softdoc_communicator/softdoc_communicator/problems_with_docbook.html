Most things went rather suprisingly well, but I did encounter a small
number of hitches.</p>

<p>
My first unpleasant surprise with the <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> toolchain came when I
tried to generate the printable PDF output on a Windows XP
machine. Rather naively, perhaps, I'd assumed that since all the
tools were Java based I'd be able to run them on any platform with a
JVM. Not so.</p>
<p>
The first time I tried a Windows build, I got a two page traceback
triggered by an exception raised in one of the graphics processing
libraries. Fortunately, I was able to work around the problem by
swapping the graphics library for an alternative version, apparently
with no adverse effects.</p>
<p>
The incident did shake my confidence, though. It may well be true that
open source tools give you the ultimate level of control, but you
don't usually want to exercise it! At this stage I had only tried
building small documents with a few images. I remained fearful that
similar problems might recur when the manual grew larger and more
laden with screenshots.</p>

<p>
We all know that healthy software tools are in active development, but
this does have a downside. Some problems actually arose from the
progression of the tools I was using. For example, I started out with
the version of the <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XSL stylesheets I scavenged from my
reference open source documentation build (version 1.65.1).</p>
<p>
These were more than good enough for my needs, but much of the <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a>
documentation I was using referred to more recent distributions. In
this case, switching to the most recent stable distribution of the XSL
stylesheets resulted in improvements all round. Apache FOP is less
mature though: the last stable version (as of December 2005) is
0.20.5&#8212;hardly a version number to inspire confidence&#8212;and the
latest release, 0.90 alpha 1, represents a break from the past. I
anticipate problems if and when I migrate to a modern version of FOP,
though again, I also hope for improvements.</p>

<a name="softdoc_communicator.verbosity"></a>Verbosity</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
XML is verbose and <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XML is no exception. As an illustration, here
is a section of a <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> document:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="literal">&lt;para&gt;
 We needed just two output formats:
 &lt;/para&gt;
 &lt;itemizedlist&gt;
 &lt;listitem&gt;
 hard copy, printed and bound
 &lt;/listitem&gt;
 &lt;listitem&gt;
 linked online web pages.
 &lt;/listitem&gt;
 &lt;/itemizedlist&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
XML claims to be human readable, and on one level, it is. On another
level, though, the clunky angle brackets and obtrusive tags make the
actual text content in the master document hard to read: the syntax
obscures the semantics.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="softdoc_communicator.control"></a>Control</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
The <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> toolchain gave us superb control over some aspects of the
documentation task. In other areas the controls existed but were
tricky to locate and operate.</p>
<p>
For example, controlling the chunking of the HTML output was
straightforward and could all be done using build time
parameters&#8212;with no modifications needed to the document
source. Similarly, controlling file and anchor names in the generated
HTML was easy, which meant the integration between the Product and the
online version of the manual was both stable and clean.</p>
<p>
Some of the printed output options don't seem so simple, especially
for someone without a background in printing. In particular, I still
haven't got to grips with fine control of page-breaking logic, and
have to hope noone minds too much about tables which split awkwardly
over pages.</p>
