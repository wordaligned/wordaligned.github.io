<p>
Despite all of these limitations and irritations it was hard to convince
anyone a change was necessary or even desirable. The reasons were as much
organisational as technical.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
The existing tools had been used to produce acceptable end user
  documentation in the past for other products shipped by the company.
</li>
<li>
Already, considerable effort had been put into the Word master for the new
  Product (even if much of it would have to be scrapped due to the inevitable
  changes as the Product developed).
</li>
<li>
The engineering team had more work than it could cope with already. At least
  the user documentation could be outsourced to a contract technical author.
</li>
<li>
Setting up a smarter toolchain would need engineering input, and, once the
  tools were in place, would the technical author be able to use them
  productively?
</li>
<li>
The sales team saw the documentation task as non-urgent for much the same
  reason that they saw user input validation as a nice-to-have rather than a
  priority. After all, they'd run some promising beta trials at customer sites
  using a poorly documented and inputs-unchecked version of the Product. They were
  happy to continue to provide support and tuition as required, either on
  site, by phone or by email.
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
I could (and did) argue against all of these points:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
existing documentation was stand-alone: it did not have to integrate with
  what it documented.
</li>
<li>
Using the existing tools to connect the new Product with
  its documentation looked like being a continual sink of effort.
</li>
<li>
The engineering team probably spent as long telling the technical author
  what to write as they might have spent writing it themselves.
</li>
<li>
Surely the technical author would quickly master a new documentation tool?
</li>
<li>
In fact it was more often the engineers than the sales team who provided
  support, and frequently for problems which could have been avoided with
  better input checking and more solid documentation.
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
As software engineers we need to concentrate on the software. That means
listening to the sales team; but when it comes to software quality, we know
best. I believe the only shortcut is to prune back the feature list
and, increasingly, I regard it as wrong to view software documentation as an
add-on. Decent documentation is one of the first things I look for when I
evaluate a piece of software: the website, the user interface, the README, the
FAQ list, and of course the source code itself (if available). Quite simply, I didn't
want to deliver a Product with poor documentation. I didn't think it would
save us time in the short or long term.</p>
