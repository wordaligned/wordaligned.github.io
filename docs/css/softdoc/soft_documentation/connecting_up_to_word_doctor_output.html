<p>
The real downside of Word Doctor was when it came to trying to connect the
Product to the Word Doctor web pages. This job fell to me. It was a
multi-layered integration task:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
on a team level I would work with the technical author
  to ensure the documentation content was correct, and contained the required
  Help topics.
</li>
<li>
on the Product side, the web-based user interface would call for help using
  a text identifier. The Help subsystem would use the identifier to look up an
  HTML location&#8212;a page and an anchor within that page&#8212;and it could then
  pop up a new window viewing this location.
</li>
<li>
on the documentation side, I would have to configure Word Doctor to ensure
  its HTML output included the right locations.
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
Unfortunately, there were problems with each of these layers.</p>
<p>
Personally, I got on well with the technical author, but the documentation
tools made it extremely hard for us to work on the same file. We had to take
it in turns or work with copies. I couldn't even fix a typo directly.</p>
<p>
The Word Doctor output was a frame-based collection of static HTML pages. Now,
externally referencing a particular location in such a set of pages is
tricky&#8212;due to the limitations of frames&#8212;so the Product's help sub-system
had to dynamically generate a framed front page displaying the appropriate
left and right pane each time it was called. Not too difficult, but more
complex than strictly necessary.</p>
<p>
Both pages and anchors were a moving target in the Word Doctor output. Every
time you added a new section to the document you broke most of the help
references. Thus we found ourselves in a situation where the technical author
wanted the Product to stabilise in order to document it and I needed the
documentation to stabilise in order to link to it.</p>
