As a software user I expect software to just work&#8212;especially
software with a GUI. It should be obvious what to do without needing
to read the manual; and preferably without even waiting for tooltips
to float into view. By designing a GUI which operates within a web
browser we already have a headstart here: the user interface is driven
like any other web interface&#8212;there's no need to document how
hyperlinks work or what the browser's address bar does.</p>
<p>
What's more, the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_top">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> explicitly
prefers: "Working software over comprehensive documentation".</p>
<p>
These considerations don't mean that the manual is redundant or
unwanted, though. There are times when we don't want to clutter the
core user interface with reference details. There remain occasions
when hardcopy is invaluable.</p>
<p>
What's more, when you try and design an intuitive user interface, you
realise that the distinction between software and documentation is
somewhat artificial: it's not so much that the boundaries blur as
that, from a user's point of view, they aren't really there. Suppose,
for example, that a form requires an email address to be entered. If
the user enters an invalid address the form is redrawn with the
erroneous input highlighted and a terse message displayed: 
<span class="emphasis"><em>Please enter a valid email address</em></span>; there will also be a clickable Help icon
directing confused users to the right page of the user manual. Which
of these elements of the user interface are software and which are
documentation?</p>
<p>
Now suppose we are delivering a library designed to be linked into a
larger program. The documentation is primarily the header files which
define the interface to this library. We must invest considerable
effort making sure these header files define a coherent and
comprehensible interface: maybe we deliver the library with some
example client code and makefiles; maybe we provide a test harness;
maybe we generate hyperlinked documentation directly from the source
files; and maybe we supply the library implementation as source
code. Now which is software and which is documentation?</p>
<p>
When we write software, we remember 
<a href="refs.html#refs.abelson_and_sussman">Abelson and Sussman's</a> advice:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally
for machines to execute.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>
In other words, software is documentation. Software should also be
soft&#8212;soft enough to adapt to changing requirements. We must be sure to
keep our documentation soft too.</p>
