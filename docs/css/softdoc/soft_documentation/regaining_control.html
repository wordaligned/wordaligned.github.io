My frustration with the existing documentation tools set me thinking about
alternatives. I looked first to the open source world (I'm using the term
loosely here), where there's no shortage of excellent documentation and where
the authors are happy to show how they generated it.</p>
<p>
I experimented by downloading and attempting to build some open source
documentation. This was a part time activity, squeezed into moments when I was
waiting for builds to complete or files to check out. If the documentation
didn't build or required lots of configuration to get it to build, I moved on.
I was looking for something as simple as:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="literal">&gt; cd docs ; make 
</code></pre>
<p>
To my surprise and disappointment it took several attempts to find
something which worked out of the box. Perhaps I was unlucky. No doubt
in many cases it was user error on my part and no doubt I could have
sought advice from email lists; nonetheless, I kept moving on until I
found something which worked first time (my thanks to the
<a href="http://www.hibernate.org" target="_top">Hibernate</a> documentation team). Then I
continued to experiment: could I change fonts, include images,
replicate the house style? How easy were the tools to use with our own
content?</p>
<p>
After a Friday afternoon's experimentation I had something worth
showing to the engineering manager: an end-to-end solution which, from
a <a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> XML master, generated a skeleton PDF and HTML user manual in
something approaching the house style.</p>
<p>
I suggested to the engineering manager that we should switch the usermanual to
use the tools I had just demonstrated. I said I'd be happy to do the work. He
agreed with me that technically, this seemed the way forwards. However, it
wasn't easy for him to give me the go ahead for the reasons already discussed.
Also, it was a hard sell for him to make to the rest of the company: on the
one hand, writing end user documentation simply wasn't what the engineers were
supposed to be doing; and on the other, it was hard enough persuading the
technical author to use the revision control system, let alone edit raw XML.</p>
<p>
I confess I had my own doubts too. All I knew at this stage was that
<a href="http://docbook.org" target="_top">DocBook</a> could do the job and that I would happily tinker with it to get it
working. I didn't know if I could be productive using it. I don't relish
editing XML either.</p>
<p>
We both recognised that the single most important thing was content. Full
and accurate documentation supplied as a plain README would be of more
practical use to our customers than something beautifully formatted and
structured but misleadingly inaccurate.</p>
<p>
In the end we deferred making a final decision on what to do with the manual.
The results of my experiment did seem worth recording, so I spent a day or so
tidying up and checking in the code so we could return to it, if required.</p>
